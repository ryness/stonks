  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** The Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) is a passive fund that invests at least 90% of its assets in the Nasdaq-100, which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq. It tracks the index compiled and maintained by Nasdaq, offering concentrated, non-diversified exposure primarily to large-cap growth areas like technology alongside other nonfinancial sectors.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** unknown
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are retail and institutional investors seeking low-cost exposure to U.S. large-cap growth via the Nasdaq-100 index. The fund covers 100 large nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq, including both domestic and international issuers with notable technology weightings.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Invesco QQQ Trust (which also tracks the Nasdaq-100) and tech-heavy ETFs such as XLK and VGT cited as alternatives. QQQM is positioned as a lower-cost Nasdaq-100 tracker relative to QQQ in recent coverage.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the price faded from a 7d local high near 261.75 with resistance at 262.23 and closed at 254.95 near support 254.61.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 257.71 and the 7d support at 254.61 looked favorable, while selling into strength around 261.75–262.23 aligned with resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** low
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** QQQM is an index-tracking ETF from Invesco tied to the long-established Nasdaq-100 methodology compiled by Nasdaq. It is non-diversified but holds 100 large-cap nonfinancial constituents. Recent week data show medium volume and low volatility, and quick facts note 1-year performance is near-peak. Institutional purchases reported in filings further suggest acceptance and stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** The ETF itself is not innovating; growth is driven by the innovation of its Nasdaq-100 constituents (e.g., tech and AI leaders). Coverage highlights low-cost exposure and outperformance versus the S&P 500 over the past year.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage from The Motley Fool highlighted QQQM as a smart, low-cost way to access tech and AI leaders with significant Magnificent Seven exposure. Institutions such as Congress Park Capital and Walker Financial disclosed sizable purchases, while articles cited roughly 24%–25% 1-year returns outperforming the S&P 500. Related pieces compare QQQM with QQQ and emphasize the Nasdaq-100’s long-run strength. With upbeat narratives and inflows, a “sell the news” reaction is plausible, aligning with quick facts indicating sell the news and not buy the rumor.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** The Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) is a passive fund that invests at least 90% of its assets in the Nasdaq-100, which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq. It tracks the index compiled and maintained by Nasdaq, offering concentrated, non-diversified exposure primarily to large-cap growth areas like technology alongside other nonfinancial sectors.

1.2. **Profitable?:** unknown

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are retail and institutional investors seeking low-cost exposure to U.S. large-cap growth via the Nasdaq-100 index. The fund covers 100 large nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq, including both domestic and international issuers with notable technology weightings.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Invesco QQQ Trust (which also tracks the Nasdaq-100) and tech-heavy ETFs such as XLK and VGT cited as alternatives. QQQM is positioned as a lower-cost Nasdaq-100 tracker relative to QQQ in recent coverage.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the price faded from a 7d local high near 261.75 with resistance at 262.23 and closed at 254.95 near support 254.61.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 257.71 and the 7d support at 254.61 looked favorable, while selling into strength around 261.75–262.23 aligned with resistance.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** low

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** QQQM is an index-tracking ETF from Invesco tied to the long-established Nasdaq-100 methodology compiled by Nasdaq. It is non-diversified but holds 100 large-cap nonfinancial constituents. Recent week data show medium volume and low volatility, and quick facts note 1-year performance is near-peak. Institutional purchases reported in filings further suggest acceptance and stability.

3.2. **Innovating?:** The ETF itself is not innovating; growth is driven by the innovation of its Nasdaq-100 constituents (e.g., tech and AI leaders). Coverage highlights low-cost exposure and outperformance versus the S&P 500 over the past year.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage from The Motley Fool highlighted QQQM as a smart, low-cost way to access tech and AI leaders with significant Magnificent Seven exposure. Institutions such as Congress Park Capital and Walker Financial disclosed sizable purchases, while articles cited roughly 24%–25% 1-year returns outperforming the S&P 500. Related pieces compare QQQM with QQQ and emphasize the Nasdaq-100’s long-run strength. With upbeat narratives and inflows, a “sell the news” reaction is plausible, aligning with quick facts indicating sell the news and not buy the rumor.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
