  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) is a passively managed ETF that seeks to track the Nasdaq-100 Index by investing at least 90% of its assets in the index’s constituents. The index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq, making the fund a concentrated (non-diversified) vehicle for large-cap growth exposure.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** unknown
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include retail investors and financial advisors/institutional allocators seeking low-cost exposure to tech and AI-led growth, as highlighted by coverage recommending QQQM for new and small-stake investors and reported advisor purchases. The ETF targets the U.S. market and provides exposure to large nonfinancial Nasdaq-listed companies with significant representation from technology leaders.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include other Nasdaq-100 and tech-focused ETFs such as Invesco QQQ (QQQ) and sector funds like XLK, VGT, and IYW. QQQM tracks the same Nasdaq-100 index as QQQ, offering an alternative path to similar exposure.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price pressed toward 7d support at 252.05, sits below the 20DMA (252.75), and could not sustain moves near the 261.75 resistance.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked favorable near the 252.05 support or around the suggested buy zone at 257.71; sells looked prudent near the 261.75 resistance/suggested sell zone.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** low
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** QQQM is an index-tracking ETF that holds the securities of the Nasdaq-100 in accordance with Nasdaq’s guidelines, providing structural stability versus a single operating company. It invests at least 90% in index constituents and does not maintain a traditional operating balance sheet, instead holding a portfolio of large, liquid stocks. The fund is legally non-diversified, implying concentration risk in Nasdaq-100 nonfinancials despite broad large-cap exposure. Recent technicals show low volatility (ATR ~1.4% of price), suggesting currently stable trading conditions.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** As a passive ETF, QQQM itself is not an operating innovator, but it provides targeted exposure to innovative tech and AI leaders within the Nasdaq-100. Recent coverage cites 24%–25.4% 1-year outperformance versus the S&P 500 and advisor allocations, indicating growth in interest and performance tied to those innovators.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights advisor purchases (Congress Park Capital, Walker Financial) and endorsements positioning QQQM as a low-cost way to access tech/AI growth, with 24%–25.4% 1-year returns outpacing the S&P 500. Articles emphasize Magnificent Seven exposure and the Nasdaq-100’s strong decade-long performance. The context suggests positive sentiment and inflows rather than rumor-driven spikes. Given quick facts indicating “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” there’s little evidence of a “buy the rumor, sell the news” dynamic in recent trading.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have influenced broader market sentiment (e.g., reports of market moves tied to tariff policies), but the supplied data does not detail a specific, measurable impact on QQQM.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) is a passively managed ETF that seeks to track the Nasdaq-100 Index by investing at least 90% of its assets in the index’s constituents. The index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on Nasdaq, making the fund a concentrated (non-diversified) vehicle for large-cap growth exposure.

1.2. **Profitable?:** unknown

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include retail investors and financial advisors/institutional allocators seeking low-cost exposure to tech and AI-led growth, as highlighted by coverage recommending QQQM for new and small-stake investors and reported advisor purchases. The ETF targets the U.S. market and provides exposure to large nonfinancial Nasdaq-listed companies with significant representation from technology leaders.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include other Nasdaq-100 and tech-focused ETFs such as Invesco QQQ (QQQ) and sector funds like XLK, VGT, and IYW. QQQM tracks the same Nasdaq-100 index as QQQ, offering an alternative path to similar exposure.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price pressed toward 7d support at 252.05, sits below the 20DMA (252.75), and could not sustain moves near the 261.75 resistance.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked favorable near the 252.05 support or around the suggested buy zone at 257.71; sells looked prudent near the 261.75 resistance/suggested sell zone.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** low

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** QQQM is an index-tracking ETF that holds the securities of the Nasdaq-100 in accordance with Nasdaq’s guidelines, providing structural stability versus a single operating company. It invests at least 90% in index constituents and does not maintain a traditional operating balance sheet, instead holding a portfolio of large, liquid stocks. The fund is legally non-diversified, implying concentration risk in Nasdaq-100 nonfinancials despite broad large-cap exposure. Recent technicals show low volatility (ATR ~1.4% of price), suggesting currently stable trading conditions.

3.2. **Innovating?:** As a passive ETF, QQQM itself is not an operating innovator, but it provides targeted exposure to innovative tech and AI leaders within the Nasdaq-100. Recent coverage cites 24%–25.4% 1-year outperformance versus the S&P 500 and advisor allocations, indicating growth in interest and performance tied to those innovators.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights advisor purchases (Congress Park Capital, Walker Financial) and endorsements positioning QQQM as a low-cost way to access tech/AI growth, with 24%–25.4% 1-year returns outpacing the S&P 500. Articles emphasize Magnificent Seven exposure and the Nasdaq-100’s strong decade-long performance. The context suggests positive sentiment and inflows rather than rumor-driven spikes. Given quick facts indicating “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” there’s little evidence of a “buy the rumor, sell the news” dynamic in recent trading.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have influenced broader market sentiment (e.g., reports of market moves tied to tariff policies), but the supplied data does not detail a specific, measurable impact on QQQM.
