  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** POET Technologies designs and develops high-speed optical engines, light sources, and custom optical modules built on its patented Optical Interposer platform. The platform integrates electronic and photonic devices at wafer level to address communication, computing, and sensing applications for AI systems and hyperscale data centers.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — cumulative net losses (~$53.9M), zero profit margin, and negative operating cash flow indicate it is not yet consistently profitable; while Q1 2025 showed net income, sustained profitability hasn’t been established.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are AI system providers and the hyperscale data center ecosystem needing integrated optical engines and light sources. Markets span communications, computing, and sensing, with operations across the United States, Canada, Singapore, and China.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitors include NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. Relative market ranking or share versus these peers is not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — labeled a downtrend, with the 5.39 close below the 20‑day average (7.08) and under 7.30 resistance.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 5.80 (suggested buy zone) or closer to 4.97 support offered better risk/reward. Selling near 6.15 (suggested sell zone) was a favorable exit area.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** POET operates across the U.S., Canada, Singapore, and China and has a patented integration platform, suggesting institutional footing rather than a fly-by-night profile. A US$150M oversubscribed offering lifts cash to over US$300M, bolstering near-term liquidity. However, cumulative net losses (~$53.9M) and negative operating cash flow (-$30.9M) indicate ongoing burn. Elevated recent volatility further tempers stability, though the strengthened cash position improves resilience.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — the patented Optical Interposer and reported manufacturing expansion with new customer engagement (e.g., Lessengers) indicate active innovation, with fresh capital earmarked for R&D scaling and potential acquisitions.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** POET Technologies priced an oversubscribed US$150M registered direct offering, boosting cash above US$300M to fund development, R&D scaling, and potential M&A. Q2 2025 results highlighted manufacturing expansion, new customer engagement with Lessengers, and a $30M private placement. Q1 2025 results reported revenue growth and net income with plans for accelerated growth in H2 2025. Separately, a biofuel company named POET announced acquiring a Tennessee bioprocessing facility, which is unrelated to POET Technologies. In terms of the buy‑the‑rumor, sell‑the‑news dynamic, the quick facts flag no clear buy‑the‑rumor or sell‑the‑news signal.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** One discussion noted the stock moved with China tariff headlines, lumped into the broader chip trade, despite POET being Canadian with manufacturing in Malaysia; the impact appears sentiment/volatility‑driven rather than a direct tariff effect.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** POET Technologies designs and develops high-speed optical engines, light sources, and custom optical modules built on its patented Optical Interposer platform. The platform integrates electronic and photonic devices at wafer level to address communication, computing, and sensing applications for AI systems and hyperscale data centers.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — cumulative net losses (~$53.9M), zero profit margin, and negative operating cash flow indicate it is not yet consistently profitable; while Q1 2025 showed net income, sustained profitability hasn’t been established.
