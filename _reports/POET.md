  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — shares are 1yr near-bottom/3mo bottom and in a downtrend, sitting well below the 20-DMA (~6.30) and 7d resistance 6.15 while hovering near 4.18 support; macro froth visibility is limited in the supplied data and overbought/sold reads 'in the middle'.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** POET Technologies designs and develops high-speed optical engines, light source products, and custom optical modules for AI systems and hyperscale data centers. Its solutions are built on the patented POET Optical Interposer, which integrates electronic and photonic devices at wafer-level. The platform addresses integration challenges across communication, computing, and sensing applications.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** no — trailing net income sums to -$53.92M with profit margin 0.0 and operating cash flow of -$30.9M, and no timeline to profitability is provided.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are AI system makers and hyperscale data center operators needing optical interconnects. Markets span communication, computing, and sensing, with operations in the United States, Canada, Singapore, and China.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors listed include NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm; relative market ranking or share for POET is not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — slid from a local high of 5.74 toward 4.40 and remains below the 20-DMA (~6.30).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buy levels appeared near the suggested buy zone around 4.97 and near support at 4.18 (intraday low 4.1804). Potential sells were near the 5.74 local high and the 6.15 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** POET Technologies is listed on the TSX Venture (PTK) and NASDAQ (POET) and operates across the U.S., Canada, Singapore, and China, indicating established operations. It is currently loss-making (TTM net loss ~$53.92M) with negative operating cash flow (-$30.9M). The company bolstered liquidity with a US$150M oversubscribed offering (raising cash to >$300M) and additional equity financing of $250M to fund development. Stock volatility is elevated (ATR ~12.3%), so while not fly-by-night, it carries higher risk than mature profitable peers.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—POET is advancing a patented Optical Interposer platform, introduced new optical receivers for AI/data centers, and is co-developing 3.2Tbps optical engines while expanding manufacturing and customer engagements. These actions indicate ongoing innovation and growth efforts.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent updates include Q3 2025 results with initial production orders of >$5.6M, $250M in equity financing, and new optical receivers for AI and data center markets. The company also priced a US$150M oversubscribed registered direct offering, boosting cash to >$300M for R&D scaling and potential acquisitions. Earlier, Q2 2025 highlighted manufacturing expansion, a new customer engagement with Lessengers, and a $30M private placement. Options markets implied an ~8.9% move around earnings. Given the quick-fact flags ('Buy the rumor? no' and 'Sell the news? no'), the classic adage hasn’t clearly applied to recent headlines.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — shares are 1yr near-bottom/3mo bottom and in a downtrend, sitting well below the 20-DMA (~6.30) and 7d resistance 6.15 while hovering near 4.18 support; macro froth visibility is limited in the supplied data and overbought/sold reads 'in the middle'.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** POET Technologies designs and develops high-speed optical engines, light source products, and custom optical modules for AI systems and hyperscale data centers. Its solutions are built on the patented POET Optical Interposer, which integrates electronic and photonic devices at wafer-level. The platform addresses integration challenges across communication, computing, and sensing applications.

1.2. **Profitable?:** no — trailing net income sums to -$53.92M with profit margin 0.0 and operating cash flow of -$30.9M, and no timeline to profitability is provided.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are AI system makers and hyperscale data center operators needing optical interconnects. Markets span communication, computing, and sensing, with operations in the United States, Canada, Singapore, and China.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors listed include NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm; relative market ranking or share for POET is not provided.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — slid from a local high of 5.74 toward 4.40 and remains below the 20-DMA (~6.30).

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buy levels appeared near the suggested buy zone around 4.97 and near support at 4.18 (intraday low 4.1804). Potential sells were near the 5.74 local high and the 6.15 resistance.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** POET Technologies is listed on the TSX Venture (PTK) and NASDAQ (POET) and operates across the U.S., Canada, Singapore, and China, indicating established operations. It is currently loss-making (TTM net loss ~$53.92M) with negative operating cash flow (-$30.9M). The company bolstered liquidity with a US$150M oversubscribed offering (raising cash to >$300M) and additional equity financing of $250M to fund development. Stock volatility is elevated (ATR ~12.3%), so while not fly-by-night, it carries higher risk than mature profitable peers.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—POET is advancing a patented Optical Interposer platform, introduced new optical receivers for AI/data centers, and is co-developing 3.2Tbps optical engines while expanding manufacturing and customer engagements. These actions indicate ongoing innovation and growth efforts.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent updates include Q3 2025 results with initial production orders of >$5.6M, $250M in equity financing, and new optical receivers for AI and data center markets. The company also priced a US$150M oversubscribed registered direct offering, boosting cash to >$300M for R&D scaling and potential acquisitions. Earlier, Q2 2025 highlighted manufacturing expansion, a new customer engagement with Lessengers, and a $30M private placement. Options markets implied an ~8.9% move around earnings. Given the quick-fact flags ('Buy the rumor? no' and 'Sell the news? no'), the classic adage hasn’t clearly applied to recent headlines.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
