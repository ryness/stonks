  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** POET Technologies designs high-speed optical engines, light sources, and custom optical modules for AI systems and hyperscale data centers. Its patented POET Optical Interposer integrates electronic and photonic devices at the wafer level to address communication, computing, and sensing applications.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — cumulative net losses (-$53.9M sum) and a 0% profit margin persist; Q1 2025 showed net income and plans for accelerated H2 2025 revenue, but no firm profitability timeline is given.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are AI system builders, hyperscale data centers, and optical module integrators seeking high-speed photonic solutions. The company serves communications, computing, and sensing markets across the United States, Canada, Singapore, and China.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** POET competes with large semiconductor and connectivity players such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, alongside photonics/module suppliers in its niches. It positions as a specialized photonic integration platform provider rather than a top-tier general-purpose chipmaker.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — it slipped from a local high of 5.74 toward support at 4.91 and closed 5.05, below the 20-DMA (~6.57).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 4.97–4.91 (suggested buy zone/support) looked attractive; selling into 5.74–6.45 (recent high/resistance) offered better exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** POET operates across the US, Canada, Singapore, and China, indicating an established footprint for a development-stage photonics firm. It strengthened its balance sheet with a US$150M oversubscribed registered direct offering, lifting cash to over US$300M for R&D scaling and corporate development. However, operating cash flow is negative (-$30.9M) and cumulative net income is -$53.9M, signaling ongoing burn. Overall, it is better funded than a fly-by-night but not yet a cash-generating, mature operator.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is advancing its Optical Interposer platform and announced co-development of 3.2 Tbps optical engines for next-gen AI connectivity with Quantum Computing Inc. 2025 updates also note manufacturing expansion and new customer engagement (e.g., Lessengers).
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** A US$150M oversubscribed registered direct offering boosted cash to over US$300M to fund R&D and potential acquisitions. 2025 updates highlighted Q1 revenue growth and net income, Q2 manufacturing expansion, new engagement with Lessengers, and a $30M private placement. On Nov 11, 2025, POET and Quantum Computing Inc. announced co-development of 3.2 Tbps optical engines for next‑gen AI connectivity. Despite these positives, shares are in a 7‑day downtrend and below the 20‑DMA, implying a muted buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news effect.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
