  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 3mo bottom and 1yr near-bottom suggest depressed levels while macro froth visibility is limited; price 4.27 sits below its 20-DMA 5.46 and EMA/SMA 5.83/6.24 but is near support 3.87 with resistance 4.99 overhead
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** POET Technologies designs and develops high-speed optical engines, light source products, and custom optical modules for AI systems and hyperscale data centers. Its solutions are built on the patented POET Optical Interposer, which integrates electronic and photonic devices into a single chip using wafer-level manufacturing. The company serves communication, computing, and sensing applications and operates in the United States, Canada, Singapore, and China.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with recent losses (last Q4 -$50.55M) and negative operating and free cash flow (-$28.18M and -$8.36M), and no stated timeline to profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are AI system builders and hyperscale data center operators, along with users in communication, computing, and sensing. Geographically, it operates and sells across the United States, Canada, Singapore, and China.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include large semiconductor and AI/data center ecosystem players such as NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. POET focuses on photonic integration modules rather than mainstream processors, positioning it as a niche developer within this landscape.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — trading below the 20-DMA (5.46) and under 7d resistance 4.99 while ranging 4.07–4.75
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buy near 4.07 or the 3.87 support; sell near 4.75 or into the 4.99 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** POET Technologies is a development-stage photonics company with ongoing losses (last Q4 -$50.55M) and negative operating cash flow (-$28.18M). Its liquidity has recently strengthened via an oversubscribed US$150M registered direct offering (taking cash over US$300M) and other financings reported in 2025. The stock exhibits high volatility (ATR ~11.3% of price), indicating elevated risk. Overall, it has funding and initial orders but remains pre-profit and dependent on external capital.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is introducing new optical receivers and advancing its patented Optical Interposer platform, with reported revenue growth of ~80% and initial production orders over $5.6M.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines show Q3 2025 results with initial production orders >$5.6M, new optical receivers, and mention of $250M equity financing, plus an oversubscribed US$150M direct offering lifting cash to >$300M to fund R&D and expansion. Earlier Q2 2025 updates cited manufacturing expansion, new customer engagement (Lessengers), and a $30M private placement. Despite positive developments, the 7d trend is down and quick facts flag no to ‘buy the rumor’ and ‘sell the news,’ implying limited follow-through post-announcements. Broader market headlines referenced Fed rate-cut hopes but were not POET-specific.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
