  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical developer focused on metabolic and endocrine disorders. Its pipeline includes orally available THR‑beta agonists VK2809 and VK0214, the SARM VK5211, and VK2735, a dual GLP‑1/GIP agonist for obesity now in Phase 3.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No; it is loss‑making with a 0% profit margin and recent net income totaling −$171.55M, alongside negative free and operating cash flow, and no profitability timeline provided in the supplied data.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** As a clinical-stage company, it has no commercial customers yet; its programs target patients with metabolic and endocrine disorders, including obesity. It is pursuing large U.S.-focused markets such as obesity (VK2735) and metabolic indications tied to THR‑beta agonism (VK2809/VK0214).
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitors include Eli Lilly (GLP‑1 obesity therapies) and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (THR‑beta metabolic/NASH). As a clinical‑stage challenger, Viking is not a market leader versus these established players.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up, with price lifting off the 35.51 local low toward 39.57 resistance and closing above the 20‑DMA (34.60).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 35.51–33.75 support looked favorable, while selling near 39.57 resistance offered exits. Suggested zones: buy ~35.51, sell ~39.57.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Viking is a clinical-stage biotech without approved products, which raises risk versus mature, revenue-generating peers. Recent financials show persistent losses (−$171.55M aggregated net income) and negative operating and free cash flow, indicating reliance on external capital. While the stock shows an uptrend technically, fundamentals remain development‑stage. Overall, it is not a fly‑by‑night, but it is not yet a financially stable, cash‑generating institution.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes; VK2735 is in Phase 3 for obesity and the company continues advancing THR‑beta programs VK2809 and VK0214, with research presentations noted in recent coverage.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights VK2735’s Phase 3 progress and strong Phase 2 weight‑loss data, with presentations slated at upcoming conferences (Motley Fool, Nov 2). Other pieces frame VKTX as a high‑risk, pre‑revenue play that surged ~36% over three months (Investing.com, Oct 27), alongside a Q3 2025 results date on Oct 22 (Benzinga, Oct 15). Earlier in 2025, articles discussed renewed M&A speculation around VKTX (Yahoo/Finance, Feb 24; Yahoo, Apr 23). In the context of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” the supplied quick facts flag no clear buy‑the‑rumor or sell‑the‑news edge currently.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Limited and indirect; management commentary noted uncertainty about potential tariff effects on future operations, with no specific stock impact detailed in the supplied data.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** up, with price lifting off the 35.51 local low toward 39.57 resistance and closing above the 20‑DMA (34.60).

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 35.51–33.75 support looked favorable, while selling near 39.57 resistance offered exits. Suggested zones: buy ~35.51, sell ~39.57.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Viking is a clinical-stage biotech without approved products, which raises risk versus mature, revenue-generating peers. Recent financials show persistent losses (−$171.55M aggregated net income) and negative operating and free cash flow, indicating reliance on external capital. While the stock shows an uptrend technically, fundamentals remain development‑stage. Overall, it is not a fly‑by‑night, but it is not yet a financially stable, cash‑generating institution.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes; VK2735 is in Phase 3 for obesity and the company continues advancing THR‑beta programs VK2809 and VK0214, with research presentations noted in recent coverage.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights VK2735’s Phase 3 progress and strong Phase 2 weight‑loss data, with presentations slated at upcoming conferences (Motley Fool, Nov 2). Other pieces frame VKTX as a high‑risk, pre‑revenue play that surged ~36% over three months (Investing.com, Oct 27), alongside a Q3 2025 results date on Oct 22 (Benzinga, Oct 15). Earlier in 2025, articles discussed renewed M&A speculation around VKTX (Yahoo/Finance, Feb 24; Yahoo, Apr 23). In the context of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” the supplied quick facts flag no clear buy‑the‑rumor or sell‑the‑news edge currently.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Limited and indirect; management commentary noted uncertainty about potential tariff effects on future operations, with no specific stock impact detailed in the supplied data.
