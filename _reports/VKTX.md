  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. Its pipeline includes VK2809 and VK0214, orally available thyroid hormone receptor beta agonists, VK5211, an oral selective androgen receptor modulator, and VK2735, a dual GLP-1/GIP obesity candidate in Phase 3. The company focuses on discovering and advancing novel small-molecule and peptide therapeutics rather than commercialized products.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No; it is pre-revenue with recurring net losses (net income sum about -$237.39M) and a 0% profit margin, alongside negative free cash flow and operating cash flow, with no disclosed timeline to profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** As a clinical-stage biotech, its ultimate end customers are patients with obesity and metabolic/endocrine disorders, accessed via healthcare providers. Current activity targets the obesity and broader metabolic therapy markets, with operations based in the United States and investor-facing engagement at healthcare conferences.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Eli Lilly in obesity/GLP-1 therapies and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals in metabolic liver disease. Viking remains a clinical-stage challenger without approved products, operating behind established incumbents.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up, with shares rebounding from ~34.67 toward a 39.00 close and trending toward the 43.15 resistance while holding above the 20-day average (~36.08).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 34.15–34.67 looked favorable, while trimming or selling near the 43.15 resistance was prudent. These levels align with the suggested buy/sell zones provided.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Viking is not a fly-by-night operation but a clinical-stage biotech with no approved products and no revenue, which elevates risk. The company has posted repeated net losses and negative free and operating cash flows, indicating reliance on external funding. Its advancing pipeline, including a Phase 3 obesity candidate and multiple thyroid hormone receptor beta programs, suggests ongoing development momentum. Overall stability hinges on clinical outcomes and financing rather than current cash generation.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes; the company is innovating with VK2735 in Phase 3 for obesity and continued progress across its thyroid hormone receptor beta assets, complemented by active participation in investor conferences.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Shares surged 44.9% in October on takeover speculation, positive VK2735 updates, and confirmed trial progress, while a high-profile investor rotated into the name alongside Eli Lilly. Coverage highlighted Phase 3 advancement and notable weight-loss data, but also emphasized that Viking remains pre-revenue and high risk. The company scheduled fireside chats and presentations at November investor conferences, sustaining visibility. In the context of buy the rumor, sell the news, recent moves appear rumor- and catalyst-driven, yet quick facts flag no clear buy-the-rumor or sell-the-news signal.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
