## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — below its 20-DMA (37.06) and sliding in a 7d downtrend toward 32.90 support after a drop from a 43.15 local high with 40.88 resistance overhead; macro froth visibility is limited in the provided data and quick facts show middle positioning across 3mo-5yr

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical developer focused on metabolic and endocrine disorders. Its pipeline consists of VK2809 and VK0214, orally available, tissue- and receptor-subtype selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonists, and VK5211, an orally available non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator. It operates in the United States.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with consecutive net losses (net income sum -$237.39M), zero profit margin, and negative free (-$150.9M) and operating cash flow (-$224.6M); timing to profitability is unknown.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** As a clinical-stage company, it has no commercial customers; it targets patients with metabolic and endocrine disorders, including obesity and diabetes referenced in recent coverage. Its intended markets are the U.S. healthcare/biotechnology markets for weight loss and related metabolic indications.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Eli Lilly (LLY) in obesity/GLP-1 treatments and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL) in thyroid receptor beta/metabolic therapies; Viking is a clinical-stage contender without approved products, so it trails commercial peers.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — labeled in a 7d downtrend and trading below the 20-DMA (37.06) near 32.90 support.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 32.90 support was favorable; selling into 40.88-43.15 resistance/local high offered better exits.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage U.S. biotech, making it more speculative than mature, profitable firms. It posts ongoing losses (aggregate net income -$237.39M) and has negative free cash flow (-$150.9M) and operating cash flow (-$224.6M), indicating reliance on external funding to sustain R&D. Trading characteristics show high volatility (ATR about 7.95% of price) and a recent downtrend. Overall, it appears operationally active but financially risky rather than a fully stable institution.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is advancing multiple clinical programs, with recent reports of VK2735 obesity trial progress and ongoing development of VK2809 and VK0214.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights Viking as a long-term healthcare pick and a play on obesity and diabetes treatments with catalysts ahead. Shares jumped in October on takeover speculation in the obesity drug space, positive VK2735 updates, and trial progress, while 5AM Venture’s exit was framed as portfolio rebalancing. Stanley Druckenmiller added VKTX alongside Eli Lilly, underscoring interest in the weight-loss market. Considering buy the rumor, sell the news, rumor-driven pops have occurred, but quick facts indicate Buy the rumor? no and Sell the news? no, favoring a buy the dip? yes stance instead.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Management commentary noted uncertainty regarding potential tariff impacts on future operations and commercial activities; no specific or quantified stock impact is provided.
