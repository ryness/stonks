  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are in a 7d downtrend but sit just above support at 36.49 and near the 20-DMA at 36.82 (close 37.76); macro froth visibility is limited, while 3mo is near-peak and 43.15 remains firm resistance
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical developer focused on metabolic and endocrine disorders. Its pipeline includes VK2809 and VK0214 (orally available thyroid hormone receptor beta agonists) and VK5211 (a selective androgen receptor modulator), and it is advancing VK2735, a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist for obesity.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable with a 0.0% profit margin, recurring net losses, and negative operating (-224.6M) and free cash flow (-150.9M); no profitability timeline is provided.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** As a clinical-stage company with no approved products or sales, it has no commercial customers yet. It develops therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders, including the obesity market around VK2735, targeting the U.S. market and broader obesity therapeutics demand.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include Eli Lilly (LLY) and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL); VKTX is a clinical-stage contender in weight-loss/metabolic therapies alongside these established peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — declined from the local high/resistance at 43.15 to 37.76 and remains below resistance
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys were favorable near 34.67 (suggested buy zone/local low), while sells were optimal near 43.15 (resistance/local high).
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotech, which implies higher risk than a mature, revenue-generating institution. It has posted sustained net losses in recent years and shows a 0.0% profit margin. Cash flows are negative (operating cash flow -224.6M and free cash flow -150.9M), and recent trading exhibits high volatility. While it maintains an active clinical pipeline, overall financial stability is limited pending clinical and financing milestones.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—innovation and growth are evident: VK2735 (obesity) has advanced with new data and is in phase 3, and the company is actively presenting at investor conferences. October’s 44.9% share surge followed takeover speculation and positive program updates.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Shares rose 44.9% in October on takeover speculation in the obesity drug space and positive VK2735 updates, with high-profile interest (e.g., Druckenmiller) also noted. Viking plans investor conference appearances in November (Stifel fireside chat; Jefferies presentation) and continues to highlight VK2735, with reports citing notable weight-loss data and phase 3 progress. Separately, 5AM Venture Management exited its stake, described as a portfolio rebalancing. In light of the ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ adage, the October move reflects rumor-driven strength, while the provided quick facts indicate no strong ‘sell the news’ bias flagged.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** The company has noted uncertainty regarding the potential impact of tariffs on future operations; no concrete stock-specific tariff effect is detailed in the supplied data.
