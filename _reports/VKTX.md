  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Viking Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on metabolic and endocrine disorders. Its pipeline includes VK2735 (a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist for obesity in Phase 3), VK2809 and VK0214 (oral, tissue-selective thyroid hormone receptor beta agonists), and VK5211 (an oral selective androgen receptor modulator).
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—Viking is pre-revenue with recurring net losses and a 0.0% profit margin, alongside negative free cash flow and operating cash flow; timing to profitability is unknown.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** As a clinical-stage company, it has no commercial customers yet. It targets the obesity and broader metabolic/endocrine therapeutics markets, with activities centered in the United States through clinical development and investor outreach.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Eli Lilly in obesity therapeutics and Madrigal Pharmaceuticals in metabolic/THR-β programs; Viking is a smaller, clinical-stage player relative to these peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up, with price rising from the recent local low (34.67) toward resistance (38.88) and closing above the 20-day average.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 34.67–34.15 (local low/support) and selling near 38.02–38.88 (local high/resistance) offered favorable levels.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** This is a clinical-stage biotech rather than a fly-by-night entity, but it is not yet a stable, cash-generating business. It has posted ongoing net losses (last four quarters totaling roughly -$171.55M) with negative operating cash flow (-$224.6M) and free cash flow (-$150.9M), indicating reliance on external financing. Participation in investor conferences and an advancing pipeline support operational continuity, yet balance-sheet risk remains elevated until approvals or partnerships materialize.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—its VK2735 obesity candidate is in Phase 3 with reported clinical updates showing meaningful weight loss, and it continues to advance multiple metabolic programs. This indicates active innovation and growth efforts.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Shares surged in October on takeover speculation in the obesity drug space and positive VK2735 updates, with continued progress confirmed in clinical trials. High-profile investor interest (e.g., Stanley Druckenmiller adding VKTX alongside LLY) highlights the market’s focus on weight-loss therapies. The company is presenting at Stifel and Jefferies conferences, while coverage labels VKTX a high-risk, high-reward, pre-revenue play with recent strong stock gains. Given the speculation-driven moves, the setup aligns more with “sell the news” than “buy the rumor,” consistent with the quick facts.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Unclear—management commentary cited uncertainty about potential tariff impacts on future operations, with no specific or quantified effect reported.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Shares surged in October on takeover speculation in the obesity drug space and positive VK2735 updates, with continued progress confirmed in clinical trials.
