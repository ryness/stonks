  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Plug Power builds an end-to-end green hydrogen ecosystem spanning production, storage, delivery, and energy generation. It is developing hydrogen “highways” in North America and Europe and delivers solutions directly and via joint ventures into material handling, e-mobility, power generation, and industrial applications.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable, with negative net income, negative free cash flow, and a deeply negative profit margin; management commentary and coverage point to a targeted path to profitability around 2028.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers operate in material handling, e-mobility, power generation, and industrial sectors. Its geographic focus includes North America and Europe through direct delivery and joint ventures.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Bloom Energy (BE), FuelCell Energy (FCEL), and Ballard Power Systems (BLDP); company IR indicates Plug leads material-handling fuel cell deployments with a dominant market share. It competes for hydrogen and fuel cell solutions across industrial and mobility applications.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slipped from a ~2.83 local high toward the 2.52–2.56 area and remains below the 20-DMA (3.14) and 7d resistance (3.05).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked best near ~2.56 and down toward 2.45 support; sells near ~2.83 with resistance around 3.05.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** This is a long-operating, publicly traded company building infrastructure across North America and Europe, but its financial profile is strained. Net income and free cash flow are negative, and recent volatility is high. Still, it secured a $525 million secured credit facility in 2025, supporting liquidity and operations. The stock sits near multi-year lows per quick facts, underscoring elevated risk despite ongoing operations.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — it is expanding green hydrogen production/electrolyzers and reported record hydrogen plant output, new hubs, and cost actions, alongside 21% revenue growth. Execution remains focused on scaling its hydrogen ecosystem.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights persistent losses and dilution risk, but also a plan to pivot toward profitability by 2028 and progress with record hydrogen production. Analysts are split on the 1-year outlook, with calls ranging from steep declines to potential upside, and some commentary posits a possible doubling by 2026 amid cost cuts and new hydrogen hubs. The company secured a $525 million secured credit facility and reported strong preliminary Q1 2025 results, while takeover rumors have circulated. Given the mixed catalysts and recent declines, “buy the rumor, sell the news” has not clearly applied here; quick facts flag ‘no’ for both.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
