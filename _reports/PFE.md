  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Pfizer is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing, and marketing prescription drugs and vaccines. Top products include Prevnar 13 (pneumococcal vaccine), Ibrance (oncology), and Eliquis (cardiovascular), with prescription drugs and vaccines comprising the majority of sales. It sells globally, with roughly 40% of revenue from international markets and significant contribution from emerging markets.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — Pfizer is profitable, with recent positive net income (e.g., $410 million in the latest quarter) and a profit margin of about 15.7%, supported by strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customer types are not specified in the provided data. Pfizer sells prescription medicines and vaccines globally, with about 40% of sales outside the U.S. Emerging markets are a major contributor.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Amgen, Gilead, Moderna, and Novavax. Pfizer remains one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical firms by sales, placing it among industry leaders.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up; price rose from a local low around 23.91 to a 25.85 close near 7d resistance at 25.90 and above the 20-DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support/suggested buy around 23.91 and selling near 24.70 (suggested sell) or into resistance around 25.90 were favorable levels.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Pfizer is a long-established, large-cap pharmaceutical company with roughly $60 billion in annual sales and global operations. Its profitability (profit margin ~15.7%) and substantial cash generation (operating cash flow ~$13.1B, free cash flow ~$14.3B) indicate a solid financial base. International diversification, with about 40% of sales outside the U.S. and notable exposure to emerging markets, adds resilience. Recent revenue (-5.9%) and earnings (-20.7%) declines signal near-term headwinds. Overall, it appears to be a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operator.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Pfizer is actively pursuing growth and innovation, highlighted by participation in the GLP-1 market and M&A such as the proposed Metsera deal under scrutiny. Coverage underscores intense competition but ongoing strategic moves to expand its portfolio.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines center on Pfizer’s pursuit of Metsera, with Novo Nordisk losing the bidding war and a law firm investigating whether Metsera’s board accepted too low a price. Commentary highlights uncertainty from patent expirations expected in 2027–2028 and complications around the Metsera transaction. Competition in GLP-1s is intense as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk expand, with Novo cutting Wegovy prices in India, and Novo also reported positive Phase 2 data for an ATTR-CM antibody. Given quick-facts indicating “Sell the news? yes” and “Buy the rumor? no,” confirmation of deals or trial updates could prompt selling into news rather than sustained rallies.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have been a headwind, with management citing about $150 million in annual costs and vulnerability to potential European measures, while tariff exemptions or policy deals have driven positive stock reactions. Net effect: episodic cost pressure and volatility tied to tariff developments.
