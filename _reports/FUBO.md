  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** FuboTV Inc. is a sports-first live TV streaming company offering tens of thousands of live sporting events along with news and entertainment. Its FuboTV platform delivers live TV and optional add-on features across Smart TVs, mobile phones, tablets, and computers. The company operates a single streaming segment.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — recent results show positive net income and a 7.6% profit margin with positive operating cash flow, though free cash flow remains negative.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are subscribers seeking live sports, news, and entertainment, with a focus on sports fans and their families. The business generates a majority of revenue in the United States with presence in other markets, and advertisers can target this audience via Fubo’s data-driven ad solutions.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Disney (Hulu + Live TV/ESPN), Netflix, and Alphabet/YouTube TV. Fubo is positioned as a sports-first niche streamer relative to these broader platforms.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid toward $3.46 and sits below the 20-DMA (~$3.68) with resistance near $4.39.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near ~$3.22 support looked favorable, while selling into ~$4.05–$4.39 (recent high/resistance) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fubo operates an established live TV streaming platform with one consolidated streaming segment and a majority U.S. revenue base. Recent metrics show a positive profit margin (7.6%) and positive operating cash flow, but free cash flow is negative and revenue declined 2.3% year over year. The stock’s five-year positioning is near-bottom and recent volatility is high, indicating elevated risk. Overall, it shows improving profitability metrics but ongoing cash flow pressures.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—innovation and growth are evident via AI-generated Instant Headlines, a new skinny sports tier (Fubo Sports), and the completed combination with Disney’s Hulu + Live TV.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Shares jumped on upbeat preliminary results and a Wedbush upgrade (+22% on July 30) and later surged around the completed combination with Disney’s Hulu + Live TV (late Oct., reports of a ~29% spike). Commentary also highlighted a relatively low P/E versus peers and inclusion in ‘under $5 to buy’ lists. However, Q3 results showed revenue down 2.3% YoY with a narrowed net loss, and the stock fell about 7% on the day. The rally into the merger followed by weakness on earnings fits a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news pattern.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
