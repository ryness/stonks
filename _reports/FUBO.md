  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** FuboTV Inc. is a sports-first live TV streaming platform offering access to tens of thousands of live sporting events plus news and entertainment across smart TVs, mobile devices, tablets, and web. It monetizes subscriptions with optional add-on content and features, and operates as a single streaming segment.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — recent data shows a positive profit margin (7.6%) and positive operating cash flow, though free cash flow is still negative.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are consumers/subscribers—especially sports fans—seeking live TV streaming of sports, news, and entertainment. The company generates most of its revenue in the United States with additional presence in other markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Netflix (NFLX), Disney’s streaming offerings (DIS, including Hulu Live TV/ESPN), and Alphabet’s YouTube TV (GOOG/GOOGL), per listed peers. Relative market ranking is unknown in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — price rebounded from lows near 3.22–3.65 toward 4.05–4.08 and sits above the 20-day average.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked attractive near support around 3.22. Sells/trim points appeared near 4.05 and toward resistance at 4.39.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fubo shows characteristics of a more established operator, with 1.613M subscribers in North America as of Q3 2024 (per company IR). It has a positive profit margin and positive operating cash flow, but free cash flow is negative and recent revenue growth was -2.3%. The single-segment streaming model and U.S.-heavy revenue base suggest focus in its core market. Overall, it appears more stable than a fly-by-night firm but still carries cash burn risk.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it has introduced features like AI-generated Instant Headlines and added content tiers such as Fubo Sports, while IR updates cite ongoing improvement in profitability metrics.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight the completed business combination with Disney’s Hulu + Live TV and shareholder approval, multiple write-ups listing Fubo among sub-$5 stocks to buy, and a Wedbush upgrade that sparked a 22% jump on preliminary beats. Benzinga noted strong price gains (up 195% year over year) and a P/E below industry averages. Broader industry context includes YouTube TV’s dispute with Disney, which kept attention on live TV streaming alternatives. Given the quick facts flagging ‘no’ for buy-the-rumor and sell-the-news, recent catalysts did not clearly follow that pattern.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** FuboTV Inc. is a sports-first live TV streaming platform offering access to tens of thousands of live sporting events plus news and entertainment across smart TVs, mobile devices, tablets, and web. It monetizes subscriptions with optional add-on content and features, and operates as a single streaming segment.

1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — recent data shows a positive profit margin (7.6%) and positive operating cash flow, though free cash flow is still negative.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are consumers/subscribers—especially sports fans—seeking live TV streaming of sports, news, and entertainment. The company generates most of its revenue in the United States with additional presence in other markets.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Netflix (NFLX), Disney’s streaming offerings (DIS, including Hulu Live TV/ESPN), and Alphabet’s YouTube TV (GOOG/GOOGL), per listed peers. Relative market ranking is unknown in the provided data.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — price rebounded from lows near 3.22–3.65 toward 4.05–4.08 and sits above the 20-day average.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it has introduced features like AI-generated Instant Headlines and added content tiers such as Fubo Sports, while IR updates cite ongoing improvement in profitability metrics.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight the completed business combination with Disney’s Hulu + Live TV and shareholder approval, multiple write-ups listing Fubo among sub-$5 stocks to buy, and a Wedbush upgrade that sparked a 22% jump on preliminary beats. Benzinga noted strong price gains (up 195% year over year) and a P/E below industry averages. Broader industry context includes YouTube TV’s dispute with Disney, which kept attention on live TV streaming alternatives.
