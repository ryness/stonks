  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are near multi-period peaks (3mo/1yr/5yr: near-peak) with AI froth concerns in headlines (“valuation problem” and pre-Nvidia-earnings jitters); price sits just below the 20-DMA (246.81 vs 248.11) and between support 224.64 and resistance 263.51.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Advanced Micro Devices designs high-performance CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators for PCs, gaming consoles, and data centers (including AI), as well as industrial and automotive applications. It is a fabless semiconductor company and a growing player in AI GPUs and related hardware. Reportable segments include Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — net income is positive across recent periods (sum ~$3.31B) with a ~10% profit margin, strong earnings growth (61%), and positive free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include PC OEMs, hyperscale/cloud data centers, and game console partners (Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox), plus industrial/automotive and embedded OEMs. Key markets span PCs, gaming, data center AI, industrial, and automotive applications.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** AMD competes primarily with Nvidia in AI/data center GPUs and Intel in x86 CPUs, with Broadcom also relevant in infrastructure. Nvidia leads AI GPUs, while AMD is positioning to expand share and growth in data center and maintains a strong CPU rivalry with Intel.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — price advanced off a 234.64 local low toward a 263.51 local high, closing 246.81 in an uptrend.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near support around 234.64 looked favorable; sells into resistance around 263.51/local highs offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** AMD appears to be a stable, established semiconductor designer with diversified end markets across PCs, gaming, data center AI, industrial, and automotive. It is profitable (profit margin ~10%) with positive operating cash flow ($6.41B) and free cash flow (~$3.25B). Recent revenue and earnings growth are robust (revenue +35.6%, earnings +61.2%). Its broad product portfolio and positive cash generation suggest resilience rather than a fly-by-night profile.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—AMD is innovating, highlighted by its push into AI GPUs/accelerators (e.g., Instinct MI350 MLPerf results) and an upbeat data center/AI growth outlook from its investor day. Newsflow points to an aggressive roadmap to challenge incumbents in AI computing.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage notes AMD rose 5.7% during a volatile week on a strong investor day and expectations for AI data center GPU and CPU share gains. Additional reports highlight first MLPerf training results on Instinct MI350 GPUs and an upbeat AI/data center growth roadmap. Broader sentiment shows AI valuation jitters and attention on Nvidia’s upcoming earnings, which can sway peer sentiment. Given quick facts indicating ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? no,’ there’s limited evidence of a classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news setup in the latest move.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** AMD’s CEO indicated tariffs could have a short-term impact on semiconductors; some commentary suggests AMD may be less exposed than certain peers due to supply chain layout. Overall, the direct effect on the stock is noted but not quantified in the provided data.
