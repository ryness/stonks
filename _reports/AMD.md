  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — sits near 7d/30d support at 204.53 with 'oversold' quick fact and 1yr/5yr marked 'middle'; macro froth risk is flagged by Amazon selling its AMD stake, and price is below the 20DMA (245.93), SMA (213.61) and EMA (218.98) amid a downtrend
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Advanced Micro Devices designs high-performance CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing chips for PCs, gaming consoles, data centers (including AI), industrial, and automotive uses. It also supplies semi-custom SoCs for the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox. Its reportable segments include Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — net income is positive across recent periods ($1.243B, $872M, $709M, $482M) with a ~10.3% profit margin and positive free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include PC OEMs, cloud/data center operators, and gaming console makers like Sony and Microsoft, plus industrial and automotive clients. Markets span data center AI, PCs, gaming, and embedded/industrial/automotive globally.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors are Nvidia in GPUs/AI accelerators and Intel in x86 CPUs; AMD is cited as the closest hardware challenger to Nvidia in AI. It competes across data center, client, and gaming segments against these peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid from 232.70 open to 206.02 close and tested 7d support at 204.53.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 204.53 support looked attractive, while the 263.51 resistance/local high was a prudent sell/trim zone.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** AMD is a well-established U.S. semiconductor designer serving diversified end markets including PCs, consoles, data centers (AI), industrial, and automotive, and it powers Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox. It generated $6.41B in operating cash flow and $3.25B in free cash flow, with a 10.3% profit margin and $3.31B cumulative net income over recent periods. These cash flows and profitability point to an institution with operational stability rather than a fly-by-night firm. While detailed balance sheet metrics aren’t provided here, the breadth of markets and consistent earnings support its stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—AMD is innovating, emerging as a prominent player in AI GPUs and related hardware. Strong revenue growth (+35.6%) and earnings growth (+61.2%) underscore ongoing expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Headlines highlight AMD teaming with Cisco and Saudi AI developer Humain to build AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, and U.S. approval enabling G42 to export advanced AI chips, signaling momentum in global AI deployments. Sector sentiment hinges on Nvidia’s earnings and guidance, which can sway AI chip peers like AMD. Notably, Amazon sold its entire AMD stake in Q3, citing valuation/bubble concerns, which can pressure the stock near peaks. In a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news context, JV and export-approval headlines may have seen pre-news enthusiasm, while large-holder selling reflects profit-taking risk on good news.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have been cited by AMD’s CEO as a potential short-term headwind via higher production costs that can bleed into end-product pricing, and prior tariff actions affected AMD/Nvidia gaming GPUs; such dynamics can weigh on margins and investor sentiment.

## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — sits near 7d/30d support at 204.53 with 'oversold' quick fact and 1yr/5yr marked 'middle'; macro froth risk is flagged by Amazon selling its AMD stake, and price is below the 20DMA (245.93), SMA (213.61) and EMA (218.98) amid a downtrend

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Advanced Micro Devices designs high-performance CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing chips for PCs, gaming consoles, data centers (including AI), industrial, and automotive uses. It also supplies semi-custom SoCs for the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox. Its reportable segments include Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.

1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — net income is positive across recent periods ($1.243B, $872M, $709M, $482M) with a ~10.3% profit margin and positive free cash flow.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include PC OEMs, cloud/data center operators, and gaming console makers like Sony and Microsoft, plus industrial and automotive clients. Markets span data center AI, PCs, gaming, and embedded/industrial/automotive globally.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors are Nvidia in GPUs/AI accelerators and Intel in x86 CPUs; AMD is cited as the closest hardware challenger to Nvidia in AI. It competes across data center, client, and gaming segments against these peers.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid from 232.70 open to 206.02 close and tested 7d support at 204.53.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 204.53 support looked attractive, while the 263.51 resistance/local high was a prudent sell/trim zone.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** AMD is a well-established U.S. semiconductor designer serving diversified end markets including PCs, consoles, data centers (AI), industrial, and automotive, and it powers Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox. It generated $6.41B in operating cash flow and $3.25B in free cash flow, with a 10.3% profit margin and $3.31B cumulative net income over recent periods. These cash flows and profitability point to an institution with operational stability rather than a fly-by-night firm. While detailed balance sheet metrics aren’t provided here, the breadth of markets and consistent earnings support its stability.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—AMD is innovating, emerging as a prominent player in AI GPUs and related hardware. Strong revenue growth (+35.6%) and earnings growth (+61.2%) underscore ongoing expansion.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Headlines highlight AMD teaming with Cisco and Saudi AI developer Humain to build AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, and U.S. approval enabling G42 to export advanced AI chips, signaling momentum in global AI deployments. Sector sentiment hinges on Nvidia’s earnings and guidance, which can sway AI chip peers like AMD. Notably, Amazon sold its entire AMD stake in Q3, citing valuation/bubble concerns, which can pressure the stock near peaks. In a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news context, JV and export-approval headlines may have seen pre-news enthusiasm, while large-holder selling reflects profit-taking risk on good news.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have been cited by AMD’s CEO as a potential short-term headwind via higher production costs that can bleed into end-product pricing, and prior tariff actions affected AMD/Nvidia gaming GPUs; such dynamics can weigh on margins and investor sentiment.
