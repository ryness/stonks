  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides core banking processing and complementary services—electronic funds transfer, payment processing, and loan processing—to U.S. banks and credit unions, with a focus on small and midsize institutions. Following its 2019 merger with First Data, it also offers merchant payment processing, and about 10% of revenue is generated internationally.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Fiserv is profitable, with positive net income (sum $3.379B), roughly 17% profit margin, and strong free cash flow ($4.19B), despite recent guidance cuts.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are U.S. banks and credit unions (especially small and midsize) and merchants needing payment processing. Its markets are predominantly U.S.-focused, with about 10% of revenue from international markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and business services/payroll firms like ADP and Paychex (per MarketBeat). Fiserv is a leading provider in core and payments, but specific market-share rankings are not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares drifted toward support at 63.71 and closed 64.45, well below the 20-day average and far from recent highs.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near 63.71–64.52 (support/suggested buy zone) were favorable; sells near 128.78 (resistance/suggested sell zone) were optimal exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv is a leading provider of banking and payments technology, bolstered by its 2019 First Data merger. It generates substantial operating cash flow ($6.34B) and free cash flow ($4.19B) and has posted positive net income across recent periods. However, Q3 2025 disappointments, leadership changes, and a large shareholder value loss indicate elevated near-term risk. Overall, it remains a sizable incumbent with cash-generative operations, suggesting underlying stability despite current turbulence.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Earnings growth is strong (~40%) but revenue growth is modest (~0.9%), and management is recalibrating after guidance cuts and leadership changes. This points to mixed momentum rather than clear innovation-led acceleration.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines cite disappointing Q3 2025 results, slashed growth expectations, leadership changes, and investigations by law firms, with shares dropping 30%–47% and about $32B in value erased. Coverage from Motley Fool and Investing.com highlights revenue and earnings misses and a strategic overhaul. The legal notices (Bragar Eagel & Squire; Hagens Berman) underscore investor backlash. This was a news-driven selloff with no preceding positive rumor setup, so the classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ dynamic did not apply.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
