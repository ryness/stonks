  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides payments and financial services technology through its Merchant Solutions and Financial Solutions segments. Offerings include merchant acquiring and digital commerce, mobile payments, fraud and security, stored-value, SaaS and pay-by-bank, the Clover point-of-sale platform, plus card processing, bill pay, P2P, ACH and real-time payments, digital banking, risk management, and related services.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with recent positive net income, an approximate 17% profit margin, and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include large enterprises and small businesses, banks and credit unions, large financial institutions, fintechs, public sector entities, and software providers. It serves the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, and other international markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Global Payments (cited as a rival in recent coverage). Relative market positioning versus peers is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares moved toward the 7d support near 64.52 from recent levels.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 64.52 (support/suggested buy zone) looked favorable, while selling near 128.78 (resistance/suggested sell zone) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 1984, Fiserv is a longstanding global fintech provider. It generates positive net income and strong operating and free cash flow, supporting a solid financial footing. Diversified offerings across merchant acquiring, payments, and digital banking add resilience. While recent guidance cuts and leadership changes introduce some execution risk, the overall institution appears stable.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating across payments and digital banking (e.g., Clover POS, real-time payments, and pay-by-bank), though management has lowered near-term growth guidance. Innovation remains evident even as the outlook resets.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines noted a Q3 miss with reduced organic revenue and earnings guidance for 2025–2026 and sweeping leadership changes, including a new CFO and two co-presidents. Argus Research commentary referenced significantly lowered 2025 EPS guidance alongside maintaining a rating. Shares rose about 2.5% after the CFO appointment, while U.S. equities were mixed but generally positive. Given the guidance cuts and leadership reset, the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news dynamic appears muted, consistent with quick facts indicating no for both.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
