  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides core account processing and complementary services such as electronic funds transfer, payment processing, and loan processing for U.S. banks and credit unions, with a focus on small and midsize institutions. Following its 2019 merger with First Data, it also delivers merchant payment processing services, with about 10% of revenue generated internationally.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with positive net income (sum ~$3.38B) and a ~17% profit margin, alongside strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are U.S. banks and credit unions (especially small and midsize) and merchants needing payment processing. Its markets are largely U.S.-centric financial services and merchant acquiring, with about 10% of revenue from international markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** unknown
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price fell from ~66.69 toward 64.52 support and remains far below 128.78 resistance.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked best near the 64.52 support; sells near the 128.78 resistance (30d resistance 131.72).
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv is a large payments and core-processing provider serving banks, credit unions, and merchants. It shows solid financial stability with positive net income (~$3.38B total), a ~17% margin, and strong operating and free cash flow ($6.34B OCF, $4.19B FCF). However, Q3 2025 revenue/earnings misses, reduced guidance, and leadership changes led to a sharp share-price drop (~30%–47%), signaling execution risk. International exposure is limited (~10% of revenue), keeping the business primarily U.S.-centric.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovation/growth signals are mixed: earnings growth is strong (+40.4%), but revenue growth is modest (+0.9%) and guidance was cut with a strategic overhaul. This points to ongoing repositioning rather than clear acceleration.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines detail a severe drop after Q3 2025, with revenue and earnings misses, lowered growth/earnings targets, leadership changes, and a strategic overhaul. Reports cite a 30%–47% collapse and roughly $32B in value erased, with at least one manager cutting holdings amid legal issues and poor performance. The broader market was buoyant (AI-led rally), but FI diverged sharply on its results. This was not a classic “buy the rumor” setup, and per the quick facts (“Buy the rumor? no; Sell the news? no”), the reaction looked more like capitulation than a tactical sell-the-news move.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

![Fiserv, Inc. logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/FI.svg)


## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides core account processing and complementary services such as electronic funds transfer, payment processing, and loan processing for U.S. banks and credit unions, with a focus on small and midsize institutions. Following its 2019 merger with First Data, it also delivers merchant payment processing services, with about 10% of revenue generated internationally.

1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with positive net income (sum ~$3.38B) and a ~17% profit margin, alongside strong free cash flow.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are U.S. banks and credit unions (especially small and midsize) and merchants needing payment processing. Its markets are largely U.S.-centric financial services and merchant acquiring, with about 10% of revenue from international markets.

1.4. **Competition:** unknown

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price fell from ~66.69 toward 64.52 support and remains far below 128.78 resistance.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked best near the 64.52 support; sells near the 128.78 resistance (30d resistance 131.72).

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv is a large payments and core-processing provider serving banks, credit unions, and merchants. It shows solid financial stability with positive net income (~$3.38B total), a ~17% margin, and strong operating and free cash flow ($6.34B OCF, $4.19B FCF). However, Q3 2025 revenue/earnings misses, reduced guidance, and leadership changes led to a sharp share-price drop (~30%–47%), signaling execution risk. International exposure is limited (~10% of revenue), keeping the business primarily U.S.-centric.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovation/growth signals are mixed: earnings growth is strong (+40.4%), but revenue growth is modest (+0.9%) and guidance was cut with a strategic overhaul. This points to ongoing repositioning rather than clear acceleration.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent headlines detail a severe drop after Q3 2025, with revenue and earnings misses, lowered growth/earnings targets, leadership changes, and a strategic overhaul. Reports cite a 30%–47% collapse and roughly $32B in value erased, with at least one manager cutting holdings amid legal issues and poor performance. The broader market was buoyant (AI-led rally), but FI diverged sharply on its results. This was not a classic “buy the rumor” setup, and per the quick facts (“Buy the rumor? no; Sell the news? no”), the reaction looked more like capitulation than a tactical sell-the-news move.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
