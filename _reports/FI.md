  ## 1. The Biz
  
  Fiserv, Inc. is a global provider of payments and financial services technology operating through Merchant Solutions and Financial Solutions. Its offerings span merchant acquiring and digital commerce, the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform, card issuing and processing, bill pay, person-to-person and account-to-account transfers, ACH and real-time payments, digital banking, fraud and risk tools, and related professional services. (ai)
  
  The company is profitable and cash-generative, reporting a profit margin of roughly 17%, operating cash flow of about $6.34 billion, and free cash flow of about $4.19 billion in recent periods, alongside cumulative net income of approximately $3.38 billion across the last four reported values. While revenue growth is modest at 0.9%, earnings growth of 40.4% indicates improved profitability versus top-line trends. (ai)
  
  Near-term prospects are tempered by recent developments: third-quarter results missed expectations and management lowered organic revenue and earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026 while announcing a new CFO and co-president roles. Market sentiment has been cautious, with shares in a downtrend and near multi-period bottoms per the quick facts, despite the company’s long operating history and diversified product and customer footprint. (ai)
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides payments and financial services technology to merchants and financial institutions through two segments: Merchant Solutions and Financial Solutions. Products include merchant acquiring, Clover point-of-sale, card issuing and processing, bill pay, P2P and A2A transfers, ACH and real-time payments, digital banking, fraud and risk management, and consulting services. (ai)
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with positive net income across recent periods and an approximate 17% profit margin, supported by strong operating and free cash flow. (ai)
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include small businesses, large enterprises, banks, credit unions, large financial institutions, fintechs, public sector entities, and software providers. The company serves the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, and other international markets. (ai)
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Fiserv competes with other payments and fintech processors, including rival Global Payments as cited in recent news. The supplied data does not specify relative market ranking. (ai)

  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with the price trending toward the 64.52 support and remaining well below the 20-day moving average. (ai)
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 64.52 support and selling near the 128.78 resistance aligned with the suggested buy/sell zones during this window. These levels framed the notable dip-buy and rebound-trim areas. (ai)
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med (ai)
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high (ai)
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Is this a fly-by-night or a stable institution?:** This appears to be a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operation, incorporated in 1984 with global reach and a broad product suite across payments and banking technology. It generates substantial operating and free cash flow and maintains profitability, indicating an ability to fund operations and investment internally. The diversified customer base across merchants, financial institutions, and public sector clients adds resilience, though recent guidance reductions signal near-term execution and growth challenges. Overall, its longevity and cash generation underpin stability despite current headwinds. (ai)
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovation is evident through offerings such as Clover point-of-sale, real-time payments, pay-by-bank, and digital banking solutions. However, management recently lowered growth guidance for 2025–2026, indicating near-term growth moderation. (ai)
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **Context:** Recent news highlights a Q3 miss, lowered organic revenue and earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026, and significant leadership changes including a new CFO from rival Global Payments and two co-presidents. Argus Research reiterated a Hold rating and noted lowered 2025 EPS guidance. Shares rose about 2.5% following the CFO appointment, even as the broader U.S. equity backdrop was mixed to modestly positive. Quick facts indicate ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? no,’ suggesting the classic adage has not been a dominant driver of recent moves. (ai)
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown (ai)
