  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides core processing and complementary services (electronic funds transfer, payment processing, loan processing) to U.S. banks and credit unions, with a focus on small and midsize institutions. Following its 2019 merger with First Data, it also delivers merchant payment processing, with roughly 10% of revenue generated internationally.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with a ~17% profit margin, positive net income, and strong free cash flow (~$4.19B).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are U.S. banks and credit unions (especially small and midsize) and merchants using its payment processing. Its markets are predominantly the United States with about 10% of revenue from international regions.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors cited include Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), ADP, Paychex, and Broadridge. Fiserv is described as a leading provider of core processing, placing it among the top players.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — trading around 63.80, below 68.00 resistance and leaning toward 60.95 support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 60.95 support looked attractive, while selling into rebounds toward the 68.00 resistance offered a prudent exit.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv is an established banking and payments technology company, strengthened by its 2019 First Data merger. It generates solid operating cash flow (~$6.34B) and free cash flow (~$4.19B) and remains profitable (~17% margin). However, disappointing Q3 2025 results, reduced guidance, leadership changes, and ensuing legal investigations have driven a sharp share-price decline and add near-term risk. The franchise appears durable, but execution and sentiment are currently pressured.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Growth looks pressured: the company cut full-year targets and revenue growth is modest at 0.9%, even as earnings growth is 40.4%. Recent headlines indicate recalibration rather than clear product-led innovation momentum.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Fiserv’s Q3 2025 miss on revenue and earnings, lowered growth outlook, and leadership changes triggered a 43%–47% stock plunge, erasing about $32B in value. Law firms including Hagens Berman, Bragar Eagel & Squire, and Scott+Scott announced investigations following the decline. Coverage emphasized reduced full-year forecasts and investor concern. The sharp post-earnings drop reflects a sell-the-news reaction, with no evident buy-the-rumor bounce in the supplied reports.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
