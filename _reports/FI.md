  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides payments and financial services technology through its Merchant Solutions and Financial Solutions segments across the U.S. and internationally. Offerings include merchant acquiring and digital commerce, mobile payments, fraud/security, pay-by-bank, Clover point-of-sale and business management, and SaaS. It also provides debit/credit and prepaid card processing, bill pay, P2P/A2A transfers, digital banking, ACH and real-time payments, risk/financial management, and professional services.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Fiserv is profitable, with positive recent net income, about a 17% profit margin, and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include large enterprises and small businesses, banks, credit unions, large financial institutions, fintechs, public sector entities, and software providers. The company serves markets in the United States, EMEA, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and internationally across merchant acquiring and financial institution technology needs.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include other fintech and payment processors such as Global Payments (cited as a rival in recent coverage). The data do not specify market share or rank.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares trended toward 64.52 support with a 66.69 close and remain well below the 20-DMA (115.70).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 64.52 support looked favorable, while selling into the 128.78 resistance was prudent. These align with the suggested buy/sell zones for the period.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv was incorporated in 1984 and has a long operating history with a global footprint. It is profitable with a ~17% profit margin and generates strong cash flow (operating cash flow about $6.34B and free cash flow about $4.19B). This cash generation supports overall stability despite recent price weakness noted in the quick facts. Leadership changes and lowered guidance introduce execution risk, but it remains an established provider in payments and financial technology.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** The company is innovating, offering real-time payments, pay-by-bank, and the Clover POS platform alongside digital banking and SaaS solutions, with earnings growth of ~40%. However, management recently lowered growth guidance for 2025–2026, tempering the near-term outlook.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent news highlights a disappointing Q3 that missed expectations, followed by lowered organic revenue and earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026, and sweeping leadership changes, including appointing Paul Todd (ex-Global Payments) as CFO and adding two co-presidents. Shares rose about 2.5% on the CFO appointment, while broader market action was mixed. Argus commentary noted reduced 2025 EPS guidance. Given the guidance cuts and leadership reset, any buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news effect looks muted, consistent with quick facts indicating no for both.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
