  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides core banking processing and complementary services such as electronic funds transfer, payment processing, and loan processing to US banks and credit unions, with a focus on small and midsize institutions. Following its 2019 merger with First Data, it also offers merchant payment processing, with about 10% of revenue generated internationally.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Fiserv is profitable, with recent positive net income and an approximate 17% profit margin, supported by strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are US banks and credit unions (especially small and midsize) and merchants via its First Data–derived payment services. Its business is primarily US-based, with roughly 10% of revenue from international markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Paychex, and Broadridge Financial (MarketBeat). Fiserv is positioned as a leading provider in core processing and payments.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, below the 20-day average and under 7d resistance (70.10) while testing support around 60.95.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked favorable near 60.95–64.52 (7d support and suggested buy zone). Potential sells were near 70.10 (7d resistance) and, on rebounds, the longer-term sell zone around 128.78.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv is a Fortune 500, long-established payments and financial technology provider that expanded materially with the 2019 First Data merger. It shows stability through consistent profitability (positive net income and ~17% margin) and robust cash generation (operating cash flow ~$6.34B and free cash flow ~$4.19B). The business is diversified across bank technology and merchant acquiring, with modest international exposure (about 10% of revenue). However, recent weak Q3 2025 results and leadership changes triggered a sharp share price decline and investor investigations, which increase near-term risk.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Mixed: while recent data show strong earnings growth, the company cut guidance and is undergoing a strategic overhaul after disappointing Q3 2025 results. This points to recalibration rather than clear acceleration in innovation.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Headlines report Fiserv’s Q3 2025 revenue and earnings misses, reduced guidance, and major leadership changes, leading to a 30%–47% stock collapse and an estimated $32B loss in shareholder value (Motley Fool, Investing.com, Hagens Berman). Law firms (e.g., Bragar Eagel & Squire) announced investigations following the sharp decline. The market reaction was decisively negative on the news, with no evident pre-announcement rally. In this context, the classic buy the rumor, sell the news setup did not materialize; instead, shares sold off on bad news without a preceding rumor-driven run-up.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
