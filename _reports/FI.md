  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Fiserv provides core processing and complementary services for U.S. banks and credit unions—including electronic funds transfer, payment processing, and loan processing—with a focus on small and midsize banks. Following its 2019 merger with First Data, it also delivers payment processing to merchants; about 10% of revenue is generated internationally.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with positive net income in recent periods and a profit margin of about 17% alongside strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are U.S. banks and credit unions (especially small and midsize institutions) and merchants that use its payment processing. Its markets are predominantly in the United States with about 10% of revenue from international operations.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** unknown
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid toward support near 64.52 and remains far below the 20-day average, consistent with the downtrend.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near the 7d support around 64.52 looked favorable. Sells near the 7d resistance around 128.78 were optimal.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv is a long-standing provider of bank technology and payments, bolstered by its 2019 First Data merger. Profitability and cash generation appear solid, with roughly a 17% profit margin and over $4.2B in free cash flow. However, Q3 2025 disappointments, lowered guidance, and leadership changes triggered a sharp share-price collapse, highlighting event risk. Its scale across banking technology and merchant processing supports durability, but near-term stability is pressured by the recent reset.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** The 2019 First Data merger broadened its merchant payments capabilities, and earnings growth of about 40% indicates recent operating progress. That said, the latest quarter’s guidance cuts and strategic overhaul point to execution challenges near term.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Shares plunged 30%–47% after Fiserv reported disappointing Q3 2025 results, cut organic growth and earnings targets, and announced leadership changes, wiping out tens of billions in value. Coverage cited a strategic overhaul and investor exits, including a manager sharply reducing its stake. This selloff occurred even as broader markets were strong that day. QuickRef notes “Buy the dip? yes,” “Buy the rumor? no,” and “Sell the news? no,” implying the move was driven by negative news rather than a rumor-fueled run-up, so the classic “sell the news” dynamic did not apply.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

1.4. **Competition:** unknown

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid toward support near 64.52 and remains far below the 20-day average, consistent with the downtrend.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near the 7d support around 64.52 looked favorable. Sells near the 7d resistance around 128.78 were optimal.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Fiserv is a long-standing provider of bank technology and payments, bolstered by its 2019 First Data merger. Profitability and cash generation appear solid, with roughly a 17% profit margin and over $4.2B in free cash flow. However, Q3 2025 disappointments, lowered guidance, and leadership changes triggered a sharp share-price collapse, highlighting event risk. Its scale across banking technology and merchant processing supports durability, but near-term stability is pressured by the recent reset.

3.2. **Innovating?:** The 2019 First Data merger broadened its merchant payments capabilities, and earnings growth of about 40% indicates recent operating progress. That said, the latest quarter’s guidance cuts and strategic overhaul point to execution challenges near term.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Shares plunged 30%–47% after Fiserv reported disappointing Q3 2025 results, cut organic growth and earnings targets, and announced leadership changes, wiping out tens of billions in value. Coverage cited a strategic overhaul and investor exits, including a manager sharply reducing its stake. This selloff occurred even as broader markets were strong that day. QuickRef notes “Buy the dip? yes,” “Buy the rumor? no,” and “Sell the news? no,” implying the move was driven by negative news rather than a rumor-fueled run-up, so the classic “sell the news” dynamic did not apply.
