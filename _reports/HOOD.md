  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Robinhood Markets operates an app-based, cloud-enabled financial services platform that designs and delivers its own investing products. Its vertically integrated platform offers brokerage and trading in equities and derivatives, cryptocurrency trading, fractional shares, recurring investments, dividend reinvestment, and fraud detection tools. It operates within Financial Services, Capital Markets.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Robinhood is profitable, with recent positive net income totaling about $1.79B and a profit margin near 50%. Revenue and earnings are growing (approximately 45% revenue growth and 105% earnings growth), supporting durability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are users of its app-based investing and crypto trading platform. It serves markets across equities, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies within Capital Markets, and is based in the United States; specific geographic mix is not disclosed in the provided data.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Coinbase (COIN) in crypto, Charles Schwab (SCHW) in brokerage, and fintech peers such as SoFi (SOFI), with other cited names like Affirm (AFRM), GameStop (GME), and AMC (AMC). The data does not specify a market rank versus these competitors.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price faded from a local high near 150.47 toward support around 135.51, and the snapshot flags a downtrend.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 137.25 (close to 7d support 135.51) offered favorable risk-reward. Selling into strength around 150.47 aligned with the 7d resistance and suggested sell zone.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Robinhood appears more stable than in prior years, supported by consecutive positive net income and operating cash flow of about $4.56B. Its ~50% profit margin and strong revenue growth indicate improved financial footing. However, the stock shows high recent volatility and low recent volume, signaling market risk. As a U.S.-based Financial Services firm in Capital Markets, it is not a fly-by-night, but results can be sensitive to trading activity.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing—its platform has added products like crypto trading, derivatives, fractional shares, recurring investments, and fraud detection. Growth metrics are strong, with about 45% revenue growth and 105% earnings growth.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Benzinga notes HOOD is in focus ahead of earnings as investors take profits after strong year-to-date rallies. Motley Fool coverage highlights a sharp rebound to profitability, S&P 500 inclusion in 2025, and a 400%+ stock surge, while flagging regulatory, market-dependency, and competition risks. Another piece cites profit margins near 40% and discusses long-term valuation scenarios. Given the “buy the rumor, sell the news” adage, the run-up and earnings focus could invite profit-taking, but quick facts say “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” suggesting a more neutral setup.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have weighed on sentiment at times, with reports tying HOOD pullbacks to tariff-related comments and markets awaiting new tariffs. The impact appears indirect, reflecting broader risk appetite rather than company-specific fundamentals.
