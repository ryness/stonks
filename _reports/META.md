  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta Platforms operates two segments: Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, WhatsApp) and Reality Labs. Its products enable social networking, messaging, and transactions for people and businesses worldwide, and it also develops VR/AR/MR hardware, software, and content.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with ~30.9% profit margin, $71.5B cumulative net income across recent periods, and positive free cash flow. Earnings growth is currently negative, but profitability remains strong.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are individuals, communities, and businesses using its apps to connect, communicate, and transact. It serves global markets across mobile, PCs, and XR devices in social networking, messaging, and commerce use cases.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Alphabet, Snap, Pinterest, and TikTok across social media and digital communication/ads. Relative positioning or rank is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down; shares fell from a local high near 759.16 toward 648.35 and trade below the 20-DMA (~719.81) near support at 645.57.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 645.57 support or the suggested buy zone around 731.15, and selling into 759.155 resistance, were favorable levels over this period.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** high
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2004 and renamed Meta in 2021, the company has an established operating history and large global platforms. Financially, it shows strong profitability (~31% margin) with substantial operating cash flow ($107.6B) and positive free cash flow. Revenue growth of 26.2% supports stability, though earnings growth is negative, indicating pressure from investments or costs. Overall, scale and cash generation point to a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating via Reality Labs in VR/AR/MR while scaling its core apps, as reflected in 26.2% revenue growth. Negative earnings growth suggests investment-heavy expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines note Big Tech-driven data center demand in early stages, macro optimism after strong tech earnings, and layoffs at large firms amid uncertainty. Alphabet’s moonshot spin-outs highlight competitive innovation in the space. Index fund write-ups emphasize Magnificent Seven exposure, keeping attention on mega-cap tech such as Meta. Quick facts indicate no clear ‘buy the rumor’ or ‘sell the news’ setup for META.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
