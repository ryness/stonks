  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — sitting at a 3mo bottom and near 7d/30d support at 583.78 with a suggested buy zone around 595.20; macro froth cues are present (fund managers’ low cash and a tech selloff) and price is below the 20DMA/EMA/SMA (660/690/711) and capped by 7d resistance 635.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the world’s largest social media platform through its Family of Apps: Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It provides these services free to users and monetizes by packaging data signals from its ecosystem to sell digital ads. The company also invests heavily in Reality Labs, though it remains a small part of sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — it posts a ~30.9% profit margin with positive net income and strong operating cash flow ($107.6B).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Its primary customers are digital advertisers across industries looking to reach users on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. End users are individuals and businesses worldwide, totaling close to 4 billion monthly active users. Markets are global with broad industry exposure through its ad platform.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include YouTube (Alphabet/Google), TikTok, and Snap, among others. Meta remains the largest social media company, with a recent court ruling citing robust competition from platforms like YouTube and TikTok.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price fell from a local high of 635.00 toward 595.20 and closed 600.89, sitting below the 20DMA at 660.31.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near 595.20 and the stronger support at 583.78 looked attractive; sells around 635.00 at 7d resistance offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta is a long-established, large-scale platform with close to 4 billion monthly active users, indicating strong durability. Financially, it shows consistent profitability (net income sum $58.53B) and substantial operating cash flow of $107.57B with positive free cash flow. A profit margin near 31% underscores fundamental strength. While short-term trading can be volatile (ATR ~4.09%), the business profile and cash generation point to a stable institution.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, with 26.2% revenue growth and ongoing heavy investment in Reality Labs. Reality Labs remains small today but reflects continued product and platform development.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Meta won a key FTC antitrust case, with a judge noting strong competition from YouTube and TikTok, which reduces regulatory overhang. A Cloudflare outage that impacted platforms including Facebook contributed to a broader tech selloff. Macro headlines highlight low cash levels among fund managers and rising funding stress, adding pressure to risk assets. Another piece framed Meta as a beaten-down opportunity despite the recent selloff. Given these, the quick facts suggest neither a classic “buy the rumor” nor “sell the news” setup right now.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate tariffs could weigh on ad demand tied to China-linked retailers, with one estimate citing up to a $7B hit, though other coverage notes Meta has largely shrugged off tariff fears and still expects growth.
