  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the Family of Apps—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—serving nearly 4 billion monthly users worldwide. It monetizes by using insights from its apps to sell targeted digital advertising; Reality Labs (AR/VR) is heavily invested in but remains a small part of overall sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — Meta is profitable, with recent net income totaling about $71.5B, a profit margin near 31%, and strong cash generation (operating cash flow ~$107.6B, free cash flow ~$18.6B).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are digital advertisers across industries buying access to Meta’s global audience, while end users are consumers using its apps worldwide. Markets are global consumer social media and digital advertising, with revenue concentrated in the Family of Apps.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Google in digital advertising and Snap in social media (among other large-cap tech peers). Meta remains the largest social media company by users.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price has slid toward 7d support (636.21) and sits well below the 20-day moving average (715.92) with RSI at 26.9.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 636–637 looked attractive, while selling or trimming near the 7d resistance around 759.16 offered a good exit.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta appears stable given its scale as the world’s largest social media company with nearly 4B monthly active users. It reports consistent profitability (profit margin ~31%) and robust cash generation (operating cash flow ~$107.6B, free cash flow ~$18.6B). While it is investing heavily in Reality Labs, that segment is a small part of sales, limiting near-term business mix risk. Overall, its size and cash flow support institutional stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing: recent revenue growth of about 26% and significant AI infrastructure and Reality Labs investments indicate ongoing expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage notes Meta’s strong Q3 with 26% revenue growth and improved ad performance, but shares fell on concerns about heavy AI infrastructure spending. Broader market context shows central banks signaling caution and investors moderating risk despite solid tech earnings. Sector discussion centers on AI infrastructure themes and key market levels. In this backdrop, the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news effect looks mixed: strong results met with cautious reaction to spending plans.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports suggest tariffs are an overhang that could dampen ad spend, yet Meta indicated continued growth and results that helped ease tariff fears. Overall, the direct impact on the stock appears limited so far.
