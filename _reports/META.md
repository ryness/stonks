  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta Platforms builds social, messaging, and commerce products that let people and businesses connect across mobile, PCs, VR/MR/AR, and wearables worldwide. It operates two segments: Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, WhatsApp) and Reality Labs, which develops and sells virtual, augmented, and mixed reality hardware, software, and content.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes; it is profitable with sustained positive net income, a ~30.9% profit margin, and strong cash generation ($107.6B operating cash flow and ~$18.6B free cash flow).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are individuals, communities, and businesses using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads to connect and transact. Meta serves global markets across mobile and desktop, and extends into VR/AR/MR through Reality Labs.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include Alphabet, Snap, Pinterest, and TikTok. The provided data does not specify rank, only that Meta competes broadly across social, messaging, ads, and immersive platforms.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down; price fell from a 7d high near 759 to a 648.35 close and sits below the 20-DMA (~719.81).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Notable buy zone around 731.15 and sell zone near 759.15 during the period; 645.57 marked support to watch for entries.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** high
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta was incorporated in 2004 and rebranded from Facebook to Meta Platforms in 2021, indicating long operating history. It shows solid profitability (profit margin ~30.9%) and cumulative positive net income (~$71.5B across the listed periods), supported by robust operating and free cash flow. The dual segments (Family of Apps and Reality Labs) provide product diversification. These factors point to a stable, established institution rather than a fly-by-night operator.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Meta is innovating via Reality Labs in VR/AR/MR and through newer apps like Threads, while delivering 26.2% revenue growth. Earnings growth is currently negative (-0.827), suggesting near-term profit pressure alongside ongoing investment.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent context highlights Big Tech-related AI data center build-outs benefiting industrials and a broader market lift from strong tech earnings and rate-cut optimism. A Vanguard piece emphasizes the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ which includes Meta, remaining central in index strategies. Alphabet’s moonshot spinouts and layoffs at other large firms add to a mixed macro and competitive backdrop. Quick facts flag ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? no,’ implying recent headlines have not offered a clear rumor/news trading edge for this stock.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
