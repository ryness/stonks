  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the world’s largest social platforms—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—used by consumers and businesses for communication, commerce, and content. It monetizes primarily through targeted digital advertising sold to advertisers across its Family of Apps, while investing in Reality Labs (AR/VR), which remains a small part of overall sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — Meta is profitable, with ~31% profit margin, positive free cash flow ($18.6B), and recent net income totaling $71.5B.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are digital advertisers seeking reach and performance across Meta’s apps, while end users include global consumers and digital businesses using its platforms. It serves worldwide markets with close to 4 billion monthly users, centered on the internet content and digital advertising ecosystem.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Alphabet/Google in digital ads and online platforms and Snap in social media, among other large-cap tech peers. Meta ranks as the largest social media company by users, giving it leading scale versus competitors.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down - price sits below the 20-DMA (693.57), faded from 642.23 toward 601.20, and is labeled a downtrend.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buy near support around 601.20; sell or trim near 642.23, with additional resistance at 674.89.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta appears stable: it is the largest social media company with close to 4 billion MAUs and highly scaled platforms. A ~31% profit margin, $71.5B in recent net income, and strong operating cash flow ($107.6B) with positive free cash flow support resilience. Reality Labs is a small part of sales, limiting concentration risk from that segment. Detailed leverage metrics are not provided here.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing: Meta is aggressively investing in AI infrastructure (higher capex and new data centers) and continues to fund Reality Labs, signaling ongoing product and platform innovation.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Coverage highlights Meta as a potentially cheap tech stock with strong AI prospects, and CEO updates point to aggressive AI infrastructure spending that benefits suppliers like Nvidia. A Benzinga roundup cited a massive U.S. AI investment figure tied to Meta, while broader market commentary noted narrow S&P 500 breadth led by AI names. Overall, AI-capex optimism is prominent, but quick-facts indicate no clear buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news setup for META right now.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff reports suggest potential pressure on Meta (e.g., a projected $7B impact and concerns noted by NYT), though other coverage said it beat expectations and boosted spending while largely shrugging off tariff fears. Net effect: tariffs are a potential headwind, but impacts appear mixed so far.
