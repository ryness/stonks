  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the Family of Apps—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—used by close to 4 billion monthly users worldwide. It monetizes these platforms by packaging user data signals to sell digital ads to advertisers. The company also invests in Reality Labs (VR/AR), which remains a small part of overall sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — Meta is profitable, with a ~30.9% profit margin, positive operating cash flow ($107.6B) and free cash flow ($18.6B), and recent net income figures all positive.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are digital advertisers buying ad placements across its apps, while consumers and businesses use the services for communication and commerce. Meta serves global markets with close to 4 billion monthly active users, spanning social media and messaging, with a nascent VR/AR business via Reality Labs.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Alphabet/Google in digital ads and Snap in social media, alongside large platforms like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Nvidia, AMD, and Tesla noted as related peers. Meta is the largest social media company, positioning it among the top platforms in its space.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slipped from a local high of 635.00 toward support (local low 607.77) and closed at 614.52, below the 20-DMA 679.04.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 607.77 (around 7d support 601.20) looked favorable; selling near 635.00 (below 7d resistance 642.23) offered profits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta is a large, long-standing platform business with close to 4 billion monthly users and substantial cash generation. It posted a profit margin of 30.9%, operating cash flow of $107.6B, and free cash flow of $18.6B, indicating strong financial footing. Recent net income figures are consistently positive, though earnings growth was negative in the period. Reality Labs is still a small contributor, reducing dependence on unproven segments.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing: the company is investing heavily in Reality Labs and recently announced a $1 billion data center investment in Wisconsin. These moves signal continued infrastructure and product development.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Meta stock has continued to slide as the company announced a $1 billion data center investment in Wisconsin while facing scrutiny over potential accounting practices, with Michael Burry questioning possible earnings overstatement (Benzinga). Motley Fool reports that Nebius, an AI infrastructure firm, has major contracts from Meta and Microsoft amid rapid growth but mounting losses. Nvidia’s upcoming Nov. 19 earnings could sway megacaps and AI sentiment broadly, while Arm’s strong results still came with volatility. Given the slide despite investment news—and quick facts flagging 'Buy the rumor? no' and 'Sell the news? no'—the setup suggests limited benefit from rumor/news trading.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports suggest tariffs could dampen advertiser spending, potentially affecting Meta (eMarketer), yet Meta signaled continued growth and ‘shrugged off’ tariff fears in results (NYT, FT). Overall impact appears mixed.
