  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the world’s largest social media ecosystem, with its Family of Apps—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—serving nearly 4 billion monthly users. It monetizes by packaging insights from its apps to sell targeted digital advertising to marketers. The company also invests in Reality Labs (VR/AR), which remains a small part of sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Meta is profitable, with consistent net income and about a 31% profit margin, plus $107.6B in operating cash flow and $18.6B in free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Meta’s primary paying customers are digital advertisers who buy access to its audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. It serves consumers globally with close to 4 billion monthly active users, operating in the online advertising and social media markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Meta competes with Alphabet/Google and Snap in digital ads and social platforms, alongside large tech ecosystems like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. It is the largest social media company by users, placing it among the top players in digital advertising.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with shares falling from a recent high near 759 toward support around 601 and closing near 609, well below the 20-day average ~706.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Pullbacks near 731.15 were better buy levels, while rallies into 759.16 offered selling opportunities. Key levels were support around 601.20 and resistance near 759.16.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta appears to be a stable, scaled institution rather than a fly-by-night. It serves close to 4 billion monthly active users and generates substantial cash flows (operating cash flow $107.6B; free cash flow $18.6B). Profitability is strong with a ~31% profit margin and consistent positive net income. Reality Labs is a small part of sales, with the core ads business driving results.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Meta is actively investing in AI and Reality Labs; recent coverage highlights elevated AI spending. Analysts cite these investments as a driver of potential recovery after the post-earnings selloff.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines note a sharp post-Q3 drop for Meta (shares fell over 11%), yet analysts maintained targets and see a recovery supported by AI investments. Broader market weakness (S&P 500 closing below key moving averages amid negative gamma and liquidity strain) adds pressure to tech stocks. Another piece highlights Meta’s 1,500% gain since IPO and posits a potential 2026 split given its high share price and AI focus. The post-earnings slump fits a “sell the news” pattern, while subsequent analyst optimism and AI narratives align with “buy the rumor” dynamics.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Coverage indicates tariffs could be a headwind, with CNBC citing an estimated ~$7B 2025 impact, and the New York Times noting tariff-related concerns. However, the Financial Times reported Meta beat expectations and boosted spending, suggesting it has recently shrugged off tariff fears.
