  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 3mo is 'near-bottom' and $594.25 is near support 581.25 but below the 20-DMA 638.55 and longer MAs (EMA 676.00, SMA 697.66), with nearby resistance 617.65; AI-bubble/froth headlines and choppy markets limit visibility despite a 'Buy the dip? yes' cue.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the Family of Apps—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—serving close to 4 billion monthly active users worldwide. It monetizes by packaging user data from its ecosystem to sell digital advertising to marketers. The company is also investing heavily in Reality Labs, though it remains a small part of overall sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — profitable with a 30.9% profit margin and strong cash generation (OCF $107.6B, FCF $18.6B).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are digital advertisers across industries purchasing ad placements on Meta’s platforms. End users span nearly 4 billion MAUs worldwide, giving the company a global market footprint in internet content and information.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Alphabet/Google and Snap, among other large internet platforms listed as related companies; Meta ranks as the largest social media company per its profile.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price closed at 594.25 in a downtrend, below the 20-DMA 638.55 and edging between the local high 606.72 and support 581.25.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 581.25 support looked attractive; selling into 606.72–617.65 (local high/7d resistance) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta appears to be a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night. It is the largest social media company with close to 4 billion monthly active users. Financially, it posts a 30.9% profit margin and generated $107.6B in operating cash flow and $18.6B in free cash flow. These scale and cash metrics suggest resilience even as it invests in Reality Labs, which is currently a small part of sales.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Meta is actively innovating, investing heavily in Reality Labs while its core business grows, evidenced by 26.2% revenue growth. This points to ongoing product and platform expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights Meta as a recommended buy ahead of 2026, with one piece explicitly naming Meta among top picks. Broader market context points to potential rate cuts, AI investment, and M&A in 2026, while other commentary flags AI froth and volatility. Another note indicates MoffettNathanson turned cautious on META due to accelerating AI spend. Given this mix, the classic ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ isn’t clearly in play, aligning with quick facts showing ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? no’.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports suggest tariffs could curb advertiser spending and pressure initiatives (with one estimate up to about $7B impact), yet other coverage notes Meta has largely shrugged off immediate tariff effects.
