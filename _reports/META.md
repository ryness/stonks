  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the Family of Apps—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—used for social networking, communication, and digital commerce. It monetizes by selling targeted advertising based on data from its app ecosystem. The company also invests in Reality Labs (AR/VR), which remains a small part of overall sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Meta is profitable, with ~31% profit margin, strong cumulative net income (~$71.5B across recent periods), and positive free cash flow. Heavy investments (e.g., Reality Labs and AI) continue but do not negate current profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are digital advertisers across industries aiming to reach Meta’s global user base. End users—nearly 4 billion monthly active—use Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, so markets are worldwide and cross-industry.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Alphabet/Google and Snap in digital advertising and social platforms, with other large tech firms (e.g., Amazon) competing for ad budgets. Meta is the largest social media company, placing it among the leaders in its category.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with price sliding from the 7d local high 759.16 toward support 641.56 and trading below the 20-DMA (716.28).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 641.56 and around the suggested buy zone 731.15 stood out; selling near resistance/suggested sell zone around 759.16 was the favorable exit.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta appears stable, supported by close to 4 billion monthly active users and sustained profitability. A ~31% profit margin, ~$107.6B operating cash flow, and positive free cash flow indicate strong cash generation. Reality Labs is a small share of sales, suggesting the core ad business underpins results. Overall, it is a large, established U.S. Communication Services company.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing—Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and advancing AR/VR (smart glasses updates and Horizon OS initiatives). Revenue grew 26% recently while Reality Labs remains small in the mix.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage notes strong Q3 results with 26% revenue growth and better ad performance, yet shares fell as Meta outlined significant AI infrastructure spending (Motley Fool). Broader market tone shows central-bank caution and moderated risk appetite despite solid tech earnings (Benzinga). Product updates included Garmin/Strava integration for smart glasses and leadership focus on Horizon OS (Android Central/ZDNet). This suggests some sell-the-news pressure around spending commentary, though quick-fact signals indicate no clear buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news edge.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs could pressure advertiser spending, but Meta signaled continued growth and results helped ease tariff fears, implying limited near-term stock impact. Overall effect appears muted/uncertain in the supplied coverage.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the Family of Apps—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—used for social networking, communication, and digital commerce. It monetizes by selling targeted advertising based on data from its app ecosystem. The company also invests in Reality Labs (AR/VR), which remains a small part of overall sales.

1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Meta is profitable, with ~31% profit margin, strong cumulative net income (~$71.5B across recent periods), and positive free cash flow. Heavy investments (e.g., Reality Labs and AI) continue but do not negate current profitability.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are digital advertisers across industries aiming to reach Meta’s global user base. End users—nearly 4 billion monthly active—use Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, so markets are worldwide and cross-industry.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Alphabet/Google and Snap in digital advertising and social platforms, with other large tech firms (e.g., Amazon) competing for ad budgets. Meta is the largest social media company, placing it among the leaders in its category.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with price sliding from the 7d local high 759.16 toward support 641.56 and trading below the 20-DMA (716.28).

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 641.56 and around the suggested buy zone 731.15 stood out; selling near resistance/suggested sell zone around 759.16 was the favorable exit.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Meta appears stable, supported by close to 4 billion monthly active users and sustained profitability. A ~31% profit margin, ~$107.6B operating cash flow, and positive free cash flow indicate strong cash generation. Reality Labs is a small share of sales, suggesting the core ad business underpins results. Overall, it is a large, established U.S. Communication Services company.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing—Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and advancing AR/VR (smart glasses updates and Horizon OS initiatives). Revenue grew 26% recently while Reality Labs remains small in the mix.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage notes strong Q3 results with 26% revenue growth and better ad performance, yet shares fell as Meta outlined significant AI infrastructure spending (Motley Fool). Broader market tone shows central-bank caution and moderated risk appetite despite solid tech earnings (Benzinga). Product updates included Garmin/Strava integration for smart glasses and leadership focus on Horizon OS (Android Central/ZDNet). This suggests some sell-the-news pressure around spending commentary, though quick-fact signals indicate no clear buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news edge.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs could pressure advertiser spending, but Meta signaled continued growth and results helped ease tariff fears, implying limited near-term stock impact. Overall effect appears muted/uncertain in the supplied coverage.
