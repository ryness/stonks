  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Meta operates the Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp Family of Apps serving nearly 4 billion monthly users. It monetizes engagement by packaging user data to sell targeted digital advertising to businesses. The firm is investing in Reality Labs, which remains a small portion of overall sales.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Meta is profitable, with ~31% profit margin, strong cumulative net income (~$71.5B), and robust operating cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are digital advertisers of all sizes seeking to reach Meta’s global user base, while end users access the apps for free. Markets are worldwide and cross-industry, with digital advertising as the core revenue driver; Reality Labs is currently a small contributor.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Alphabet/Google and Amazon in digital ads, and Snap in social/messaging; large platforms like Microsoft and Apple also compete for user attention. Meta is the largest social media company by users, positioning it among the leaders.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares fell from ~759 resistance toward ~626 support and sit below the 20-DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Good buy levels were around 731.15 and sells near 759.16 per suggested zones. Support at 626.28 is another notable potential bounce area.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Meta is a large, long-standing platform business with global scale and recurring ad revenue. It shows solid profitability (~31% margin) and significant operating cash flow ($107.6B) alongside positive free cash flow. The Family of Apps underpins stability, while Reality Labs is small relative to sales. Overall, cash generation and scale indicate a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating—Meta is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and expanding ad opportunities on WhatsApp and Threads, alongside ongoing Reality Labs development. Recent results included 26% revenue growth as these initiatives progress.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage says Meta delivered 26% revenue growth and 20% EPS growth in Q3, but shares fell on concerns about high AI-related capital expenditures (Motley Fool). The company is expanding ad monetization on WhatsApp and Threads and expects continued growth into 2026 (Motley Fool). Quick facts flag 'Buy the dip? yes' but 'Buy the rumor? no' and 'Sell the news? no,' indicating weakness on good news without a clear rumor-driven run-up. This mirrors some 'sell the news' behavior even as the dataset labels it 'no.'
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
