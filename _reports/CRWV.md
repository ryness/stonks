  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure company offering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform—proprietary software and GPU/CPU cloud services—to automate and run complex AI infrastructure at scale. Its products include GPU compute, CPU compute, and storage services that support training and serving next-generation AI models and applications.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—CoreWeave is loss-making with a negative profit margin (-28.8%) and cumulative net losses (~$1.02B), with coverage citing a potential path to profitability by late 2026/early 2027.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are large AI and hyperscale users (e.g., Microsoft and Meta cited by analysts) needing high-performance GPU cloud for training and inference. Markets span AI infrastructure and data-center workloads supporting next‑gen AI applications across the globe, with operations based in the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include major AI/cloud players such as NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Meta, alongside other software infrastructure peers. CoreWeave positions as a specialized AI cloud; specific market share rankings are not disclosed.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares slipped from a local high near 138.36 and the latest close 121.81 sits below the 20‑DMA (133.41) and near 7‑day support 118.43.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Good buys were near support around 118.43–130.41, while rallies toward 138.36 and up to 141.79 were favorable sell/trim zones.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2017 and publicly listed on Nasdaq in March 2025, CoreWeave is young but rapidly scaling. It remains unprofitable (cumulative net loss about $1.02B, margin -28.8%) yet generated positive operating cash flow of $637.9M, indicating improving cash generation. The business targets mission-critical AI workloads, but capital intensity and recent IPO status add execution and funding risk. Overall it is more established than a fly‑by‑night startup, though still in a build‑out phase.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing—revenue growth is strong (about 206% YoY) and the platform underpins development and deployment of ground‑breaking AI models and applications.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Coverage names CoreWeave among AI infrastructure stocks to buy and suggests it could potentially triple, while an Evercore ISI note reiterated Outperform with a $175 target. Investing.com reported insider selling and short interest driving volatility but cited potential profitability by late 2026/early 2027. Headlines also referenced its Core Scientific bid, with the CEO later saying a rejected offer came down to price. With bullish projections and deal chatter, buy‑the‑rumor/sell‑the‑news risk may rise around positive headlines.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have weighed on CRWV, with tech stocks including CoreWeave selling off and the stock extending losses on tariff news days; the impact appears sentiment-driven rather than operational. Overall effect: negative for near-term stock performance when tariff fears spike.
