  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — trading near the 3mo 'near-bottom' and close to 7d support at 65.22 but well below the 20DMA (102.21) and 7d resistance at 85; headlines flag AI/hyperscaler froth (50% one-month drop, valuation warnings) and the short-term trend is down
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure company offering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform to manage complex AI infrastructure at scale. Its proprietary software and cloud services support building, training, and serving AI models and applications, with products including GPU compute, CPU compute, and storage services. It operates in the Software - Infrastructure industry.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with a -17.8% profit margin and cumulative net loss of -$766.65M; timing to profitability is unknown in the provided data.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Core customers are AI developers and enterprises building and deploying AI applications, with large clients such as Microsoft and Meta referenced by analysts. Markets are technology and AI infrastructure, operating from the United States and supporting workloads globally via its cloud platform.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta in AI infrastructure/cloud per the provided competitor lists; relative market positioning or rank is not specified in the data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — it fell from a recent 7d high near 83.49 to close at 71.65 and tested support around 65.22 intraday.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Better buys appeared near 70.47 and the 65.22 support; sells near 83.49 and into the 85.00 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was established in 2017 and listed on Nasdaq in March 2025, making it a relatively young public company. Financially, it is loss-making with a -17.8% profit margin and cumulative net loss of -$766.65M. Free cash flow is deeply negative (-$6.95B), though operating cash flow is positive (~$1.69B), indicating capital intensity. Rapid revenue growth (133.7%) supports scale, but the combination of losses and high volatility suggests elevated risk versus mature peers.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, evidenced by 133.7% revenue growth and a platform built for cutting-edge AI models and applications. Recent headlines note a partner delay that slowed growth, though management remains optimistic about future expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a partner delay that slowed revenue growth while management remains optimistic about expansion. Another piece notes a nearly 50% one-month drop amid rising skepticism toward AI stocks. Nvidia-related reporting flags risks from large vendor financing to AI customers, a macro overhang for the ecosystem. Additional articles warn of stretched valuations yet also flag oversold setups, underscoring mixed sentiment. In this context, quick facts show no clear buy-the-rumor or sell-the-news setup.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have coincided with sharp moves in CRWV—shares surged 41.8% on Apr 1 during tariff-focused market coverage and later extended losses on Jul 11 amid tariff worries—suggesting sensitivity to trade policy news; specific long-term impacts are not detailed.
