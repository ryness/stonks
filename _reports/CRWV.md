  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are in a 7d downtrend and trading near 3-month bottom and above 1y/5y lows rather than at extremes, while sector-wide AI hyperscaler bubble concerns are raised in media without CRWV-specific froth signals; price sits below its 20-day DMA (92.61) and well under SMA/EMA (117.54/106.53) but is only modestly above 7d/30d support around 65.22 and below resistance at 83.49 and 150.40, making timing tricky
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure technology company focused on providing GPU- and CPU-based compute, storage, and related cloud services for AI workloads through its CoreWeave Cloud Platform. Its proprietary software and infrastructure deliver automation and efficiency for managing complex AI infrastructure at scale. The platform supports building, training, and serving advanced AI models and applications across a range of use cases.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** no — CoreWeave is not currently profitable, as indicated by a negative profit margin of -17.80%, cumulative net income of -$766.65M over recent quarters, and deeply negative free cash flow despite strong revenue growth.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave primarily serves enterprises and developers that require large-scale AI infrastructure to build, train, and deploy advanced AI models and applications. Its customer base includes major technology companies such as Microsoft and Meta referenced in analyst commentary, reflecting a focus on hyperscale and high-intensity AI users. The company operates in the global cloud computing and AI infrastructure markets from its base in the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** CoreWeave’s primary competitors are large cloud and infrastructure providers and software players such as CrowdStrike, NetEase, Snowflake, Cloudflare, MongoDB, VeriSign, Twilio, GoDaddy, Okta, as well as broader AI and cloud hyperscalers including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta. Available data lists these peers but does not provide a clear ranking of CoreWeave’s market position among them.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d Trend is labeled 'down' and the stock has moved from a higher 7d resistance of 83.49 toward the current price near 73.89 and support at 65.22.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** During the last week, the area near the local low and suggested buy zone around 66.00 and the 7d/30d support at 65.22 would have been better buy levels, while the region near the local high and suggested sell zone around 74.21 offered more favorable short-term selling opportunities.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was founded in 2017 (originally as Atlantic Crypto) and went public on Nasdaq in March 2025, giving it less than a decade of operating history and only a short track record as a public company. It has rapidly grown revenue to about $4.31B trailing but remains loss-making with cumulative recent net losses of roughly $767M and highly negative free cash flow of about -$6.95B, indicating heavy investment and financial risk. The company operates in a volatile, capital-intensive AI infrastructure segment and is backed by major partners like Nvidia, but its negative profit margin and significant cash burn suggest it is not yet a fully stable, mature institution. Market commentary noting reduced revenue guidance and sharp stock drawdowns underscores execution and cyclicality risks.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** CoreWeave is clearly innovating and growing, with its specialized AI-focused cloud platform, strong backlog growth, and guidance for multi-fold revenue expansion cited in earnings coverage. However, this aggressive growth is accompanied by substantial capital needs and ongoing losses.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights CoreWeave’s extremely volatile trading, including a plunge of about 50% in a single month and commentary that this may signal exhaustion in the broader AI trade. Articles note reduced revenue guidance tied to data center build-out delays, which led to a sharp stock sell-off despite earlier strong backlog growth and bullish analyst ratings. Nvidia’s large and somewhat opaque investment activity in AI firms, including CoreWeave, has raised Wall Street questions about ‘murky’ circular investments and hyperscaler bubble risk. At the same time, some analysts still rate CRWV a Buy and see potential for a rebound as the company addresses infrastructure bottlenecks. In this environment, upside from optimistic rumors (e.g., AI demand and Nvidia linkage) appears partly priced in and vulnerable to “sell the news” reactions when guidance or macro sentiment disappoints.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** News flow links broader market sell-offs and volatility in CRWV with renewed tariff concerns and Trump-era trade tension headlines, indicating that tariff announcements have contributed to pressure on the stock, but the precise quantitative impact on CoreWeave’s fundamentals is not detailed; therefore the specific effect on its stock beyond added volatility is unknown.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are in a 7d downtrend and trading near 3-month bottom and above 1y/5y lows rather than at extremes, while sector-wide AI hyperscaler bubble concerns are raised in media without CRWV-specific froth signals; price sits below its 20-day DMA (92.61) and well under SMA/EMA (117.54/106.53) but is only modestly above 7d/30d support around 65.22 and below resistance at 83.49 and 150.40, making timing tricky

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure technology company focused on providing GPU- and CPU-based compute, storage, and related cloud services for AI workloads through its CoreWeave Cloud Platform. Its proprietary software and infrastructure deliver automation and efficiency for managing complex AI infrastructure at scale. The platform supports building, training, and serving advanced AI models and applications across a range of use cases.

1.2. **Profitable?:** no — CoreWeave is not currently profitable, as indicated by a negative profit margin of -17.80%, cumulative net income of -$766.65M over recent quarters, and deeply negative free cash flow despite strong revenue growth.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave primarily serves enterprises and developers that require large-scale AI infrastructure to build, train, and deploy advanced AI models and applications. Its customer base includes major technology companies such as Microsoft and Meta referenced in analyst commentary, reflecting a focus on hyperscale and high-intensity AI users. The company operates in the global cloud computing and AI infrastructure markets from its base in the United States.

1.4. **Competition:** CoreWeave’s primary competitors are large cloud and infrastructure providers and software players such as CrowdStrike, NetEase, Snowflake, Cloudflare, MongoDB, VeriSign, Twilio, GoDaddy, Okta, as well as broader AI and cloud hyperscalers including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta. Available data lists these peers but does not provide a clear ranking of CoreWeave’s market position among them.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d Trend is labeled 'down' and the stock has moved from a higher 7d resistance of 83.49 toward the current price near 73.89 and support at 65.22.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** During the last week, the area near the local low and suggested buy zone around 66.00 and the 7d/30d support at 65.22 would have been better buy levels, while the region near the local high and suggested sell zone around 74.21 offered more favorable short-term selling opportunities.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was founded in 2017 (originally as Atlantic Crypto) and went public on Nasdaq in March 2025, giving it less than a decade of operating history and only a short track record as a public company. It has rapidly grown revenue to about $4.31B trailing but remains loss-making with cumulative recent net losses of roughly $767M and highly negative free cash flow of about -$6.95B, indicating heavy investment and financial risk. The company operates in a volatile, capital-intensive AI infrastructure segment and is backed by major partners like Nvidia, but its negative profit margin and significant cash burn suggest it is not yet a fully stable, mature institution. Market commentary noting reduced revenue guidance and sharp stock drawdowns underscores execution and cyclicality risks.

3.2. **Innovating?:** CoreWeave is clearly innovating and growing, with its specialized AI-focused cloud platform, strong backlog growth, and guidance for multi-fold revenue expansion cited in earnings coverage. However, this aggressive growth is accompanied by substantial capital needs and ongoing losses.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights CoreWeave’s extremely volatile trading, including a plunge of about 50% in a single month and commentary that this may signal exhaustion in the broader AI trade. Articles note reduced revenue guidance tied to data center build-out delays, which led to a sharp stock sell-off despite earlier strong backlog growth and bullish analyst ratings. Nvidia’s large and somewhat opaque investment activity in AI firms, including CoreWeave, has raised Wall Street questions about ‘murky’ circular investments and hyperscaler bubble risk. At the same time, some analysts still rate CRWV a Buy and see potential for a rebound as the company addresses infrastructure bottlenecks. In this environment, upside from optimistic rumors (e.g., AI demand and Nvidia linkage) appears partly priced in and vulnerable to “sell the news” reactions when guidance or macro sentiment disappoints.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** News flow links broader market sell-offs and volatility in CRWV with renewed tariff concerns and Trump-era trade tension headlines, indicating that tariff announcements have contributed to pressure on the stock, but the precise quantitative impact on CoreWeave’s fundamentals is not detailed; therefore the specific effect on its stock beyond added volatility is unknown.
