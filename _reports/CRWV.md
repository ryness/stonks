  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — shares are in a confirmed downtrend trading well below the 20-day moving average and near 3-month bottom levels with support around 65.22; macro froth context is limited while recent class-action-driven drops and high volatility suggest elevated event risk rather than a stable entry setup
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave, Inc. is a modern cloud infrastructure technology company focused on providing the CoreWeave Cloud Platform for AI workloads at scale. Its proprietary software and cloud services deliver automated, efficient management of complex AI infrastructure, supporting development and deployment of advanced AI models and applications. The company positions itself as an AI-focused cloud provider within the Software - Infrastructure segment.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** no — the company is not currently profitable, with a net income sum of -$766.65M, a negative profit margin of -17.8%, and deeply negative free cash flow despite strong revenue growth.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave primarily serves enterprises and AI-focused customers that require large-scale GPU and CPU compute, storage, and infrastructure for training and deploying advanced AI models and applications. Its markets are centered in the United States technology and cloud infrastructure space, and it is expanding into areas like the U.S. federal sector according to company news. The company is part of the broader AI ecosystem, supporting high-profile AI initiatives referenced in coverage such as OpenAI-related data centers.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** CoreWeave competes with major cloud and AI infrastructure providers such as NVIDIA-backed platforms, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Meta's AI infrastructure, and other AI-focused clouds like Nebius. It is described as an emerging AI infrastructure provider in a market dominated by these larger hyperscalers, implying a smaller but rapidly growing player relative to them.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — over the last week the stock fell from the mid-90s to the low-to-mid 70s and is labeled in a downtrend, trading below both its recent resistance at 83.49 and its moving averages.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** During the last 7 days, trades near the suggested buy zone and local low around 66.00–65.22 would have offered better entries, while the local high and suggested sell zone around 74.21–83.49 represented more attractive short-term selling or trimming levels.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave is not a fly-by-night entity but also not yet a mature, low-risk institution. It was established in 2017 and completed its Nasdaq listing in March 2025, giving it only a short public track record. Financially, it shows strong revenue growth but significant net losses and strongly negative free cash flow, indicating a reliance on continued capital and investment to fund expansion. Multiple securities class action lawsuits alleging misleading statements about infrastructure capacity and supplier risk further cloud perceptions of stability. Overall, it is a fast-growing but still volatile and legally encumbered AI cloud provider rather than a fully proven stable blue chip.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** CoreWeave appears to be innovating and growing, with record quarterly revenues, strong revenue backlog, and new products such as its VAST Data storage partnership and entry into the U.S. federal market. However, this rapid growth is accompanied by infrastructure delays and execution issues highlighted by recent legal actions.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent news around CoreWeave is dominated by multiple securities fraud class actions alleging it overstated its ability to meet AI infrastructure demand and understated risks tied to a single data center supplier, with specific focus on delays at projects like an OpenAI data center in Texas. These reports note that the stock plunged about 34% following a failed Core Scientific merger, guidance cuts, and disclosures of delays, triggering a wave of law firm alerts ahead of a March 13, 2026 lead-plaintiff deadline. At the same time, other coverage highlights strong demand, record revenue, and expanded collaborations (e.g., with NVIDIA) that had previously fueled optimism and share gains. In the context of "buy the rumor, sell the news," earlier hype around AI growth and marquee partnerships appears to have been followed by a sharp derating as negative execution news and legal risks emerged. Current headlines suggest the market remains focused on litigation and infrastructure risk rather than on speculative upside rumors.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have mainly impacted CoreWeave indirectly through broader market volatility, with reports noting that CRWV shares moved sharply during weeks of tariff-related market swings, but no specific, quantified tariff effect on its fundamentals is detailed, so the precise impact is unknown.

## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — shares are in a confirmed downtrend trading well below the 20-day moving average and near 3-month bottom levels with support around 65.22; macro froth context is limited while recent class-action-driven drops and high volatility suggest elevated event risk rather than a stable entry setup

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave, Inc. is a modern cloud infrastructure technology company focused on providing the CoreWeave Cloud Platform for AI workloads at scale. Its proprietary software and cloud services deliver automated, efficient management of complex AI infrastructure, supporting development and deployment of advanced AI models and applications. The company positions itself as an AI-focused cloud provider within the Software - Infrastructure segment.

1.2. **Profitable?:** no — the company is not currently profitable, with a net income sum of -$766.65M, a negative profit margin of -17.8%, and deeply negative free cash flow despite strong revenue growth.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave primarily serves enterprises and AI-focused customers that require large-scale GPU and CPU compute, storage, and infrastructure for training and deploying advanced AI models and applications. Its markets are centered in the United States technology and cloud infrastructure space, and it is expanding into areas like the U.S. federal sector according to company news. The company is part of the broader AI ecosystem, supporting high-profile AI initiatives referenced in coverage such as OpenAI-related data centers.

1.4. **Competition:** CoreWeave competes with major cloud and AI infrastructure providers such as NVIDIA-backed platforms, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Meta's AI infrastructure, and other AI-focused clouds like Nebius. It is described as an emerging AI infrastructure provider in a market dominated by these larger hyperscalers, implying a smaller but rapidly growing player relative to them.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — over the last week the stock fell from the mid-90s to the low-to-mid 70s and is labeled in a downtrend, trading below both its recent resistance at 83.49 and its moving averages.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** During the last 7 days, trades near the suggested buy zone and local low around 66.00–65.22 would have offered better entries, while the local high and suggested sell zone around 74.21–83.49 represented more attractive short-term selling or trimming levels.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave is not a fly-by-night entity but also not yet a mature, low-risk institution. It was established in 2017 and completed its Nasdaq listing in March 2025, giving it only a short public track record. Financially, it shows strong revenue growth but significant net losses and strongly negative free cash flow, indicating a reliance on continued capital and investment to fund expansion. Multiple securities class action lawsuits alleging misleading statements about infrastructure capacity and supplier risk further cloud perceptions of stability. Overall, it is a fast-growing but still volatile and legally encumbered AI cloud provider rather than a fully proven stable blue chip.

3.2. **Innovating?:** CoreWeave appears to be innovating and growing, with record quarterly revenues, strong revenue backlog, and new products such as its VAST Data storage partnership and entry into the U.S. federal market. However, this rapid growth is accompanied by infrastructure delays and execution issues highlighted by recent legal actions.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent news around CoreWeave is dominated by multiple securities fraud class actions alleging it overstated its ability to meet AI infrastructure demand and understated risks tied to a single data center supplier, with specific focus on delays at projects like an OpenAI data center in Texas. These reports note that the stock plunged about 34% following a failed Core Scientific merger, guidance cuts, and disclosures of delays, triggering a wave of law firm alerts ahead of a March 13, 2026 lead-plaintiff deadline. At the same time, other coverage highlights strong demand, record revenue, and expanded collaborations (e.g., with NVIDIA) that had previously fueled optimism and share gains. In the context of "buy the rumor, sell the news," earlier hype around AI growth and marquee partnerships appears to have been followed by a sharp derating as negative execution news and legal risks emerged. Current headlines suggest the market remains focused on litigation and infrastructure risk rather than on speculative upside rumors.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have mainly impacted CoreWeave indirectly through broader market volatility, with reports noting that CRWV shares moved sharply during weeks of tariff-related market swings, but no specific, quantified tariff effect on its fundamentals is detailed, so the precise impact is unknown.
