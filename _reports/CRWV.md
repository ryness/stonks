  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave, Inc. operates an AI-focused cloud platform providing GPU and CPU compute, storage, networking, managed services, and both virtual and bare-metal servers to scale GenAI workloads for enterprises. Its platform includes fleet and node lifecycle controllers, a tensorizer, and observability, with services spanning VFX/rendering, AI model training and inference, mission control, and a dataset optimization tool.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable, with a -28.83% profit margin and roughly $1.02B in cumulative net losses, though operating cash flow is positive ($637.9M).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and developers running AI and high-performance workloads, including VFX/rendering studios and machine-learning teams. Markets span GenAI infrastructure, model training/inference, and rendering services; the company is U.S.-based.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft Azure and data/AI infrastructure providers such as Snowflake, Databricks, and C3.ai. CoreWeave positions as a specialized AI cloud for GPU-intensive workloads rather than a general-purpose hyperscale cloud.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares trade below the 20-DMA (133.87), failed near 138.36, and closed at 128.36 with support around 125.99.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 130.41 or at support around 125.99 looked favorable; selling into 138.36 or near 141.79 resistance offered better exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2017 (renamed in 2019) and based in New Jersey, the company is younger than mature incumbents but not a fly-by-night. It is still posting net losses (profit margin -28.83% and about $1.02B cumulative losses) yet generated positive operating cash flow of $637.9M. With rapid revenue growth (~206.7%), it appears to be a scaling growth platform. Overall stability is moderate: growth is strong but profitability and track record are still developing.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing, with an AI cloud stack (GPU/CPU compute, lifecycle controllers, tensorizer, dataset optimization) and strong revenue growth of about 206.7%.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight surging AI capex by Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta; Amazon’s $38B Nvidia chip deal for OpenAI; and AI cloud capacity wins by Iren and Cipher Mining with Microsoft and AWS. Coverage also asks where CoreWeave stock will be in a year, underscoring investor focus on AI infrastructure demand. Quick facts indicate “Buy the dip? yes” but “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” suggesting dips have been preferable to chasing headlines.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff-related headlines have pressured tech and AI shares broadly, with reports noting CoreWeave extended losses on tariff news and market swings tied to tariff developments. Overall, the impact appears sentiment-driven rather than company-specific in the provided data.
