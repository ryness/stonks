  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — price is in a 7d downtrend and a 3mo 'bottom', trading near 7d support at 72.55 and far below the 20-DMA (112.80), EMA (115.75) and SMA (122.46); macro froth risk is flagged in headlines citing AI-bubble concerns while quick facts show 'Buy the dip? yes' and no 'buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news' bias.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure company offering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform, a stack of proprietary software and cloud services to manage complex AI infrastructure at scale. Its platform supports building, training, and serving advanced AI models and applications. Reported offerings include GPU and CPU compute and storage services.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is unprofitable with negative net income totaling -$766.65M and a -17.8% profit margin; timing to profitability is unknown.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave serves enterprises and developers building AI applications, with notable large tech customers such as Meta (reported $14B contract). It targets AI infrastructure workloads (training and inference) globally, while being a U.S.-based company.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta per related/competitor lists; its exact rank versus these large peers is not specified.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the stock closed at 75.33 in a downtrend, sitting near 7d support at 72.55 and well below the 110.30 7d resistance.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Better buys appeared near support around 72.55. Sells looked favorable near resistance around 110.30.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave is a relatively new public company (listed in March 2025) but has been operating since 2017 per investor materials. Financially, it shows ongoing losses (-$766.65M total recent net income) and deeply negative free cash flow (-$6.95B) despite positive operating cash flow ($1.69B). Revenue growth is strong (+133.7%), indicating rapid scale-up, but funding needs appear high. Elevated volatility (ATR ~11.46%) and a current downtrend suggest higher risk versus mature, steady institutions.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating and growing, with >100% revenue growth and a large reported backlog (e.g., $55.6B) tied to AI infrastructure demand, though profitability remains a challenge.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines place CRWV on oversold watchlists and highlight potential rebounds tied to Nvidia earnings and AI dip-buying calls. Coverage notes skyrocketing revenue and a large backlog, including a reported $14B Meta deal, but also flags profitability headwinds and short equipment lifecycles. The company missed a quarter, cut 2025 guidance amid data center issues, and shares plunged over 50%. This backdrop fits a buy-the-rumor (AI catalysts) but sell-the-news (guidance/misses) pattern, so traders should be mindful of catalyst timing.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have coincided with pressure on CRWV and extended losses alongside tech peers, adding to volatility. However, coverage indicates the direct company-specific impact of tariffs is unclear.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave serves enterprises and developers building AI applications, with notable large tech customers such as Meta (reported $14B contract). It targets AI infrastructure workloads (training and inference) globally, while being a U.S.-based company.

1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta per related/competitor lists; its exact rank versus these large peers is not specified.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent headlines place CRWV on oversold watchlists and highlight potential rebounds tied to Nvidia earnings and AI dip-buying calls. Coverage notes skyrocketing revenue and a large backlog, including a reported $14B Meta deal, but also flags profitability headwinds and short equipment lifecycles. The company missed a quarter, cut 2025 guidance amid data center issues, and shares plunged over 50%. This backdrop fits a buy-the-rumor (AI catalysts) but sell-the-news (guidance/misses) pattern, so traders should be mindful of catalyst timing.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have coincided with pressure on CRWV and extended losses alongside tech peers, adding to volatility. However, coverage indicates the direct company-specific impact of tariffs is unclear.
