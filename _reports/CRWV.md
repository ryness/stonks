  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave provides a specialized cloud platform for AI, delivering proprietary software and infrastructure to automate and manage large-scale GPU/CPU compute and storage for training and serving advanced models. Its CoreWeave Cloud Platform targets complex AI workloads and next‑gen AI applications across industries.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with negative net income (cumulative loss ~$1.02B and profit margin -28.8%); coverage points to a potential path to profitability by late 2026/early 2027.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and AI developers requiring high-performance GPU cloud for AI workloads; coverage cites Microsoft and Meta as notable customers. It serves the AI infrastructure/data center market, U.S.-based with global AI application demand.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Nvidia (AI/GPU cloud), Microsoft Azure, and Meta’s in‑house AI infrastructure; CoreWeave is a specialized AI cloud provider relative to hyperscalers, with broader market share positioning not disclosed.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — trading below the 20‑DMA (131.86) and trending toward 7d support (113.75) after rejection near 138.36.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Notable buy levels: ~130.41 (recent local low) and watch 113.75 as key support on dips. Notable sell level: ~138.36 (local high/resistance).
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2017 and publicly listed in 2025, CoreWeave is more established than a fly‑by‑night startup but remains an early-stage public company. Financially, it shows strong operating cash flow ($638M) and very rapid revenue growth (206.7%) alongside sizable losses and negative margins. Elevated recent volatility (ATR ~7.3% of price) and ongoing net losses indicate higher risk despite scaling operations.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating and growing rapidly, evidenced by its AI‑focused cloud platform and triple‑digit revenue growth. Coverage highlights expanding AI data center capacity and strong demand for specialized GPU infrastructure.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage frames CoreWeave as a top AI infrastructure play, with pieces like “2 AI Infrastructure Stocks to Buy Now” and projections that it could potentially triple over the next two years. An Investing.com report noted insider selling and rising short interest, contributing to volatility while reiterating a strong growth outlook and a potential profitability window in late 2026/early 2027. The mix of bullish features and insider‑selling headlines suggests bouts of hype and pullbacks, aligning with the risk of buy‑the‑rumor/sell‑the‑news dynamics.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have coincided with broader market selloffs in which CRWV extended losses, indicating sentiment pressure rather than a clear company‑specific effect. Overall impact on CRWV’s fundamentals is unclear.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave provides a specialized cloud platform for AI, delivering proprietary software and infrastructure to automate and manage large-scale GPU/CPU compute and storage for training and serving advanced models. Its CoreWeave Cloud Platform targets complex AI workloads and next‑gen AI applications across industries.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with negative net income (cumulative loss ~$1.02B and profit margin -28.8%); coverage points to a potential path to profitability by late 2026/early 2027.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and AI developers requiring high-performance GPU cloud for AI workloads; coverage cites Microsoft and Meta as notable customers. It serves the AI infrastructure/data center market, U.S.-based with global AI application demand.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Nvidia (AI/GPU cloud), Microsoft Azure, and Meta’s in‑house AI infrastructure; CoreWeave is a specialized AI cloud provider relative to hyperscalers, with broader market share positioning not disclosed.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — trading below the 20‑DMA (131.86) and trending toward 7d support (113.75) after rejection near 138.36.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Notable buy levels: ~130.41 (recent local low) and watch 113.75 as key support on dips. Notable sell level: ~138.36 (local high/resistance).

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2017 and publicly listed in 2025, CoreWeave is more established than a fly‑by‑night startup but remains an early-stage public company. Financially, it shows strong operating cash flow ($638M) and very rapid revenue growth (206.7%) alongside sizable losses and negative margins. Elevated recent volatility (ATR ~7.3% of price) and ongoing net losses indicate higher risk despite scaling operations.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating and growing rapidly, evidenced by its AI‑focused cloud platform and triple‑digit revenue growth. Coverage highlights expanding AI data center capacity and strong demand for specialized GPU infrastructure.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage frames CoreWeave as a top AI infrastructure play, with pieces like “2 AI Infrastructure Stocks to Buy Now” and projections that it could potentially triple over the next two years. An Investing.com report noted insider selling and rising short interest, contributing to volatility while reiterating a strong growth outlook and a potential profitability window in late 2026/early 2027.
