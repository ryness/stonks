  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure company offering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform, a proprietary software and cloud services stack purpose-built to automate and run complex AI infrastructure at scale. The platform supports building, training, and serving cutting-edge AI models and applications globally. It also underpins AI data services through partnerships such as a $1.17 billion agreement with VAST Data to provide the data foundation for its AI cloud.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with cumulative net losses of about $1.02B and a -28.8% profit margin; while revenue growth is strong (about 206.7%), losses persist.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are organizations developing and deploying AI workloads—teams building, training, and serving models that require specialized GPU cloud infrastructure. The company operates from the United States and supports AI applications across global markets. Recent coverage and partnerships indicate focus on AI-intensive industries requiring scalable compute and data services.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitors cited include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta per the provided competitor candidates. Relative market positioning or share versus these peers is not specified in the data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with shares closing at 104.01 near 7d support (100.02) and well below the 20-DMA (~128.30).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Notable buy areas were near ~130.41 and on dips toward support around 100.02, while selling into strength near ~138.36 aligned with resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was established in 2017 and listed on Nasdaq in March 2025, indicating a relatively young but rapidly scaling enterprise. It generated positive operating cash flow ($637.9M) yet remains loss-making, with cumulative net losses of about $1.02B and a negative profit margin. Large-scale agreements like the $1.17B VAST Data partnership and strong revenue growth suggest operational scale. Overall, it appears more established than a fly-by-night firm but not yet a profit-stable institution.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, evidenced by 206.7% revenue growth and expansion of AI infrastructure via major partnerships and new data center projects. Recent coverage highlights it as a direct play on AI infrastructure buildout.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight a $1.17B VAST Data partnership to serve as the data foundation for CoreWeave’s AI cloud and coverage naming CoreWeave among AI infrastructure stocks to buy, with some projecting outsized growth. Sector context includes Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar GPU-access deal with Iren, underscoring demand for AI compute. CoreWeave’s attempted acquisition of Core Scientific was reportedly rejected, while it is involved in building a massive data center in Texas. Despite bullish sector and partnership news, the stock shows a 7d downtrend, suggesting news may be getting faded near-term. The quick facts flag “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” implying no clear rumor/news trading setup at present.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have pressured the stock, with reports noting CRWV “tanked” or “extended losses” on tariff news. Overall, tariffs appear to introduce negative sentiment and added volatility rather than a clearly quantified fundamental impact.
