  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure company offering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform, a mix of proprietary software and cloud services to manage complex AI infrastructure at scale. Its platform supports training, inference, and deployment of advanced AI models and next‑generation AI applications.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with cumulative net losses of about $1.02B and a profit margin of -28.8%, though operating cash flow is positive ($637.9M) alongside strong revenue growth.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are AI developers and enterprises building, training, and serving AI applications that require specialized AI/GPU infrastructure. Markets are focused on AI cloud infrastructure and data center workloads, operating from the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors and related names in the dataset include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta. Relative market positioning or rank versus these firms is not specified.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares closed at 104.01 below the 20‑DMA (128.30) and far under recent highs near 138.36, approaching 7‑day support at 100.02.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 130.41 and selling into 138.36 stood out as favorable levels during the period. The 100.02 support also marked a notable defensive buy area.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was established in 2017 and listed on Nasdaq in March 2025. Financially it is scaling with strong revenue growth (206.7%) and positive operating cash flow ($637.9M), but it remains loss‑making with roughly $1.02B in cumulative net losses and a negative profit margin. Large commercial agreements, such as the $1.17B VAST Data partnership to power its AI cloud, add visibility and support. Overall, it appears more like a rapidly scaling operator than a fly‑by‑night firm, albeit with ongoing profitability risk.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, evidenced by rapid revenue growth and its specialized AI cloud platform. Recent headlines highlight major partnerships and data‑center expansion initiatives supporting AI workloads.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent news includes a $1.17B VAST Data partnership to serve as the primary data foundation for CoreWeave’s AI cloud and articles highlighting CoreWeave as a top AI infrastructure pick with potential significant upside. Other coverage notes CoreWeave helping build a massive new data center in Texas and the collapse of its bid for Core Scientific. Additional commentary projects substantial growth and positions the stock among AI infrastructure names to watch. Given these headlines, the dataset’s quick facts indicate neither a clear ‘buy the rumor’ nor ‘sell the news’ pattern.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have pressured the stock, with reports of CRWV falling on tariff news in April and July 2025, indicating sensitivity to trade/tariff risk. Overall impact appears sentiment‑driven rather than company‑specific fundamentals.
