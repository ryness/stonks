  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud-infrastructure company delivering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform to automate and operate complex AI workloads at scale. Its offerings include proprietary software and cloud services such as GPU compute, CPU compute, and storage to build, train, and serve next-generation AI applications. It operates within Software - Infrastructure.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains loss-making, with a -17.8% profit margin and cumulative net losses of $656.5M, despite 133.7% revenue growth; no clear profitability timeline is provided.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Its primary customers are AI model developers and enterprises needing high-performance compute for training and inference; analyst commentary cites Microsoft and Meta among customers. The company is U.S.-based and serves the AI cloud/infrastructure market, including large-scale data center deployments.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitors include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta. As a newer public company, exact market-share ranking versus these larger players is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares closed at 85.43, well below the 20DMA (121.53) and near 7d support (85.32).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Better buys appeared near 85.32 support or around the prior suggested buy zone near 100.02; selling into 110.30 and toward 123.24 resistance offered favorable exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2017 and public since March 2025, CoreWeave has a short public history but growing scale. It generated positive operating cash flow ($1.69B) while free cash flow is deeply negative (-$6.97B) due to heavy capital expenditures, and it remains unprofitable (-$656.5M over the last four quarters). Management trimmed outlook due to data center capacity deployment delays, underscoring execution and supply constraints. Overall, it appears capital-intensive and fast-growing rather than fly-by-night.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — strong revenue growth (133.7% YoY) and expansion of AI infrastructure, including a massive new Texas data center project, indicate active innovation and growth.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** CoreWeave beat Q3 revenue expectations at $1.365B but cut its full-year outlook due to data center capacity delays, sending shares down roughly 9% premarket. AI infrastructure names including CoreWeave also fell amid concerns of a sector pullback, while broader markets paused awaiting government shutdown resolution. Additional headlines flagged its rejected bid for Core Scientific and plans to build a large Texas data center. The setup reflects a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news dynamic: strong prints met selling on guidance cuts and sector jitters.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have pressured CRWV, with the stock sliding alongside tech peers on tariff news and extending losses on such days. Longer-term, specific tariff cost impacts to the company were not detailed in the provided data.
