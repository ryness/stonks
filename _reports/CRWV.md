  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are in a 3-month near-bottom zone and ~60% below the 30d resistance of 150.40 but still above long-term lows, while macro commentary flags broader AI-bubble concerns from figures like Ray Dalio and Michael Burry; price is in a clear downtrend below the 20-day SMA (~92.61) and other moving averages with support near 65.22 and resistance around 83.49, suggesting caution around entries
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave, Inc. is a modern cloud infrastructure technology company focused on high-performance AI compute. It offers the CoreWeave Cloud Platform, providing proprietary software and cloud services such as GPU compute, CPU compute, and storage to support training and serving advanced AI models at scale. Its services enable customers to build and deploy next-generation AI applications.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** no — the company is not currently profitable, with a trailing profit margin of -17.80%, cumulative net income of about -$766.65M over recent quarters, and negative free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave primarily serves enterprises and developers building and deploying AI applications that require large-scale GPU and CPU cloud infrastructure. Its markets are focused on high-performance AI and cloud computing in the technology sector, with operations and customers centered in the United States but supporting global AI workloads via its cloud platform.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** CoreWeave's primary competitors include large software-infrastructure and cloud providers such as Snowflake, Cloudflare, Datadog, Roblox (platform infrastructure), MongoDB, VeriSign, Twilio, GoDaddy, and Okta, as listed in peer comparisons. Within this group it is positioned as an AI-focused hyperscaler rather than a general-purpose cloud, but no explicit market-share ranking is provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d Trend is labeled 'down' and the stock is trading well below the 7d resistance of 83.49 while hugging support around 65.22–74.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** During the last week, the suggested buy zone was near the local low around 66.00 close to 7d support at 65.22, while the suggested sell zone was near the local high around 74.21, below 7d resistance at 83.49. Buying near support and trimming near the mid-70s would have captured the short-term range despite the prevailing downtrend.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was established in 2017, launched its cloud platform in 2020, and went public on Nasdaq in March 2025, indicating it is a relatively young but not fly-by-night company. It has generated substantial trailing twelve-month revenue of about $4.31B and strong revenue growth of 133.7%, suggesting meaningful scale. However, it remains unprofitable with a -17.80% profit margin and negative free cash flow of roughly -$6.95B, which adds financial risk. The market capitalization around $38–40B and backing from major institutions like Bridgewater provide some stability, but the balance sheet is still in investment and build-out mode rather than mature stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** CoreWeave is clearly in a high-growth, innovating phase, with rapid revenue growth (guidance suggesting ~174% annual growth) and a focus on advanced AI infrastructure and data centers. News about expanding AI cloud capacity and addressing data center delays underscores ongoing investment and innovation rather than a stale business.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights CoreWeave as a key AI hyperscaler tied into the broader AI boom, including institutional buying by Bridgewater even as commentators like Ray Dalio and Michael Burry warn about a potential AI bubble and hyperscaler accounting risks. Other articles note reduced revenue guidance that triggered a sharp stock selloff, followed by debate on whether data center build-out issues can be resolved and support a rebound. There is also scrutiny around Nvidia's vendor-financing practices and its relationships with AI partners, indirectly affecting sentiment toward CoreWeave. In the context of 'buy the rumor, sell the news,' the stock's post-IPO surge and subsequent drop on guidance cuts and bubble fears suggest that good news and hype were largely priced in and later sold, while current skepticism could set up future 'buy the rumor' phases if execution improves.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have contributed to broader market and tech-stock volatility, with articles noting that Dow and AI-related names, including CoreWeave, moved on tariff news, but it is not clear that tariffs have a direct, outsized impact on CoreWeave's fundamentals. Some analysis explicitly states it is unclear why tariffs would significantly affect CoreWeave, implying that tariff moves mostly influence its stock through overall market sentiment rather than company-specific exposure.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are in a 3-month near-bottom zone and ~60% below the 30d resistance of 150.40 but still above long-term lows, while macro commentary flags broader AI-bubble concerns from figures like Ray Dalio and Michael Burry; price is in a clear downtrend below the 20-day SMA (~92.61) and other moving averages with support near 65.22 and resistance around 83.49, suggesting caution around entries

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave, Inc. is a modern cloud infrastructure technology company focused on high-performance AI compute. It offers the CoreWeave Cloud Platform, providing proprietary software and cloud services such as GPU compute, CPU compute, and storage to support training and serving advanced AI models at scale. Its services enable customers to build and deploy next-generation AI applications.

1.2. **Profitable?:** no — the company is not currently profitable, with a trailing profit margin of -17.80%, cumulative net income of about -$766.65M over recent quarters, and negative free cash flow.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** CoreWeave primarily serves enterprises and developers building and deploying AI applications that require large-scale GPU and CPU cloud infrastructure. Its markets are focused on high-performance AI and cloud computing in the technology sector, with operations and customers centered in the United States but supporting global AI workloads via its cloud platform.

1.4. **Competition:** CoreWeave's primary competitors include large software-infrastructure and cloud providers such as Snowflake, Cloudflare, Datadog, Roblox (platform infrastructure), MongoDB, VeriSign, Twilio, GoDaddy, and Okta, as listed in peer comparisons. Within this group it is positioned as an AI-focused hyperscaler rather than a general-purpose cloud, but no explicit market-share ranking is provided.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d Trend is labeled 'down' and the stock is trading well below the 7d resistance of 83.49 while hugging support around 65.22–74.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** During the last week, the suggested buy zone was near the local low around 66.00 close to 7d support at 65.22, while the suggested sell zone was near the local high around 74.21, below 7d resistance at 83.49. Buying near support and trimming near the mid-70s would have captured the short-term range despite the prevailing downtrend.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was established in 2017, launched its cloud platform in 2020, and went public on Nasdaq in March 2025, indicating it is a relatively young but not fly-by-night company. It has generated substantial trailing twelve-month revenue of about $4.31B and strong revenue growth of 133.7%, suggesting meaningful scale. However, it remains unprofitable with a -17.80% profit margin and negative free cash flow of roughly -$6.95B, which adds financial risk. The market capitalization around $38–40B and backing from major institutions like Bridgewater provide some stability, but the balance sheet is still in investment and build-out mode rather than mature stability.

3.2. **Innovating?:** CoreWeave is clearly in a high-growth, innovating phase, with rapid revenue growth (guidance suggesting ~174% annual growth) and a focus on advanced AI infrastructure and data centers. News about expanding AI cloud capacity and addressing data center delays underscores ongoing investment and innovation rather than a stale business.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights CoreWeave as a key AI hyperscaler tied into the broader AI boom, including institutional buying by Bridgewater even as commentators like Ray Dalio and Michael Burry warn about a potential AI bubble and hyperscaler accounting risks. Other articles note reduced revenue guidance that triggered a sharp stock selloff, followed by debate on whether data center build-out issues can be resolved and support a rebound. There is also scrutiny around Nvidia's vendor-financing practices and its relationships with AI partners, indirectly affecting sentiment toward CoreWeave. In the context of 'buy the rumor, sell the news,' the stock's post-IPO surge and subsequent drop on guidance cuts and bubble fears suggest that good news and hype were largely priced in and later sold, while current skepticism could set up future 'buy the rumor' phases if execution improves.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have contributed to broader market and tech-stock volatility, with articles noting that Dow and AI-related names, including CoreWeave, moved on tariff news, but it is not clear that tariffs have a direct, outsized impact on CoreWeave's fundamentals. Some analysis explicitly states it is unclear why tariffs would significantly affect CoreWeave, implying that tariff moves mostly influence its stock through overall market sentiment rather than company-specific exposure.
