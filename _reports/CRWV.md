  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure provider offering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform—proprietary software and cloud services designed to automate and run complex AI infrastructure at scale. Its platform supports training and serving cutting-edge AI models and applications, delivering GPU-centric compute and related infrastructure services for AI workloads.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with negative net income (cumulative -$1.02B) and a profit margin of -28.8%, though it is scaling rapidly (revenue growth ~207% YoY) and generating positive operating cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises, AI developers, and platforms building, training, and serving AI models; analyst commentary also references large tech customers like Microsoft and Meta. The company is U.S.-based and serves AI application markets globally, per its platform focus on next‑generation AI use cases.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta in AI infrastructure and hyperscale cloud. CoreWeave is a specialized AI cloud player competing alongside these much larger firms.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares closed at 106.93, well below the 20‑day average (131.46) and near 7‑day support (104.10) after sliding from higher levels.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buy near 104.10 support and sell into 141.79 resistance; an earlier range also flagged ~130.41 (buy) and ~138.36 (sell) as tactical levels.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** CoreWeave was established in 2017 and listed on Nasdaq in March 2025, indicating operating history beyond a fly‑by‑night profile. The company has sizable operating cash inflow ($638M) but remains loss‑making with cumulative net losses of about $1.02B and a negative profit margin. Rapid revenue growth (~207% YoY) and large commercial partnerships (e.g., a $1.17B deal with VAST Data) support business durability. Elevated volatility suggests the equity remains higher risk even as the operating footprint expands.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—CoreWeave is innovating and growing, as evidenced by its AI‑focused cloud platform, strong revenue growth, and a $1.17B partnership with VAST Data to scale next‑generation AI infrastructure.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent news includes a $1.17B commercial partnership with VAST Data to underpin CoreWeave’s AI cloud data foundation. Commentary pieces highlight CoreWeave among AI infrastructure names to buy and even project outsized upside, while broader sector news (e.g., Microsoft’s $9.7B GPU access deal with Iren) underscores demand for AI compute. There are also signs of profit‑taking and mixed sentiment in adjacent AI infra stocks (e.g., insider sales at Applied Digital). Given the hype‑leaning headlines followed by concrete deal announcements and the stock’s current downtrend/high volatility, the setup aligns with buy the rumor, sell the news dynamics.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Effects are unclear; headlines link broader market swings to tariff news and mention CRWV among movers, but no company‑specific, sustained tariff impact is provided.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** CoreWeave is a modern cloud infrastructure provider offering the CoreWeave Cloud Platform—proprietary software and cloud services designed to automate and run complex AI infrastructure at scale. Its platform supports training and serving cutting-edge AI models and applications, delivering GPU-centric compute and related infrastructure services for AI workloads.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with negative net income (cumulative -$1.02B) and a profit margin of -28.8%, though it is scaling rapidly (revenue growth ~207% YoY) and generating positive operating cash flow.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises, AI developers, and platforms building, training, and serving AI models; analyst commentary also references large tech customers like Microsoft and Meta. The company is U.S.-based and serves AI application markets globally, per its platform focus on next‑generation AI use cases.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta in AI infrastructure and hyperscale cloud. CoreWeave is a specialized AI cloud player competing alongside these much larger firms.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent news includes a $1.17B commercial partnership with VAST Data to underpin CoreWeave’s AI cloud data foundation.
