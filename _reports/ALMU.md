  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Aeluma is a U.S. semiconductor company developing novel optoelectronic sensors and communications devices, including sensor technology for mobile devices and vehicles. It manufactures high-performance compound semiconductor devices on large-diameter substrates for applications across mobile, automotive, defense & aerospace, communications, AI, AR/VR, and quantum computing.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No: it is unprofitable with a -64.8% profit margin and negative operating cash flow; while revenue is growing and a recent capital raise supports commercialization, a profitability timeline is not provided.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include government/defense agencies and OEMs needing high-performance sensing and communications chips. Markets span mobile, automotive, defense & aerospace, communications, AI, AR/VR, and quantum computing, with recent revenue driven by R&D and government contracts. The company is based in the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitors include NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. Aeluma is an emerging, smaller player transitioning to commercialization with no disclosed market share ranking.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, falling from a local high near 15.80 to about 13.85, trading near 7-day support 13.53 and below the 20-DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 13.53 looked favorable. Selling into 15.80–16.18 resistance zones offered opportunities to trim.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Aeluma appears early-stage but is strengthening its footing, having uplisted to NASDAQ and closed an oversubscribed $25.4M offering that raised cash to $39.2M. It remains unprofitable with negative operating and free cash flow, indicating reliance on capital and contracts. The acquisition of significant capital equipment to bolster wafer-scale testing supports manufacturing readiness. High recent volatility (ATR ~8.35% of price) signals elevated risk despite improving resources.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—Aeluma is innovating with novel optoelectronic devices and large-diameter substrate manufacturing, and it is accelerating manufacturing readiness. Growth is evident with a 366.7% YoY Q4 revenue jump driven by R&D contracts.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight an oversubscribed $25.4M public offering that lifted cash to $39.2M, a 366.7% YoY Q4 revenue jump largely from R&D contracts and government awards, and an acquisition of capital equipment to accelerate wafer-scale testing and manufacturing readiness. The company also cited a NASDAQ uplisting and capital raise improving its financial position. Despite positive announcements, shares have trended down over the last week, suggesting limited “sell the news” behavior and little evidence of a “buy the rumor” setup in the period described.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

1.1. **Activities:** Aeluma is a U.S. semiconductor company developing novel optoelectronic sensors and communications devices, including sensor technology for mobile devices and vehicles. It manufactures high-performance compound semiconductor devices on large-diameter substrates for applications across mobile, automotive, defense & aerospace, communications, AI, AR/VR, and quantum computing.

The company is based in the United States.

1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitors include NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm. Aeluma is an emerging, smaller player transitioning to commercialization with no disclosed market share ranking.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, falling from a local high near 15.80 to about 13.85, trading near 7-day support 13.53 and below the 20-DMA.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 13.53 looked favorable. Selling into 15.80–16.18 resistance zones offered opportunities to trim.

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight an oversubscribed $25.4M public offering that lifted cash to $39.2M, a 366.7% YoY Q4 revenue jump largely from R&D contracts and government awards, and an acquisition of capital equipment to accelerate wafer-scale testing and manufacturing readiness. The company also cited a NASDAQ uplisting and capital raise improving its financial position. Despite positive announcements, shares have trended down over the last week, suggesting limited “sell the news” behavior and little evidence of a “buy the rumor” setup in the period described.
