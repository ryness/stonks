  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-25T01:30:13.768291+00:00">2025-11-25 01:30 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 23s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities flashed a clear risk-on tone with broad gains: S&P 500 +1.55%, Nasdaq Composite +2.69%, Russell 2000 +1.89%, and Dow 30 +0.44%. Breadth was strong (12 up, 3 down) and the VIX fell 12.42% to 20.52, indicating improving risk appetite on the day.
  
  Futures reinforced the rebound as S&P (+1.48%), Nasdaq (+2.58%), and Russell (+1.77%) outpaced Dow (+0.33%). That said, the 7-day tape remains mixed to softer for large-cap benchmarks (ES -0.61%, NQ -0.64%, YM -2.26%) while small caps held firmer (RTY +1.14%), suggesting risk appetite is recovering but not fully healed over the week.
  
  Rates aided the bid with the 10Y yield down to 4.04% (-0.62% 1d, -1.80% 7d), while the US Dollar slipped marginally (-0.04% 1d). Despite the daily vol crush, the VIX is still higher over 30 days (+7.83%), so the immediate risk-on impulse coexists with a still-elevated medium-term volatility backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks constructive in the near term. Breadth skewed positive (12 up, 3 down) and the average 1-day index change was a robust +1.76%, led by growth-heavy benchmarks. Volatility eased materially (VIX -12.42% to 20.52) alongside a softer 10Y yield (4.04%, -0.62% 1d), providing a supportive rates and vol context. However, with VIX still up over 30 days and some weekly index declines, the recovery is improving but not yet decisive.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated back to growth, with the Nasdaq Composite the standout at +2.69% 1d and QQQ +2.56% 1d. Small caps also outperformed (Russell 2000 +1.89% 1d), while the Dow lagged at +0.44% 1d. Over the last week, the Russell led (+1.31% 7d) whereas the Dow 30 underperformed (-2.13% 7d), marking it a notable laggard.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fed-related tone helped risk assets after commentary boosted confidence in potential rate cuts, as noted by Investopedia, aligning with a 1-day drop in the 10Y yield (-0.62%) and a sharp VIX decline (-12.42%). This combination supported a risk-on bid across equities, particularly growth indices. AI and mega-cap tech narratives continued to steer sentiment. MarketWatch and Fortune highlighted AI-driven swings and a turbulent week, while the latest session saw tech leadership with the Nasdaq +2.69% and Nasdaq futures +2.58% 1d, signaling a renewed risk-on impulse tied to the growth/AI complex. A perceived data vacuum in rates (Yahoo: bond rally facing a waiting game) and a holiday-affected calendar (CNBC noting Thanksgiving closures) leave macro catalysts lighter, focusing attention on positioning and existing narratives. In this context, lower yields and subdued volatility supported the day’s constructive tone.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up, 62% — Broad 1-day strength (avg index +1.76%) with tech leadership (Nasdaq +2.69%), falling VIX (-12.42% to 20.52), supportive rates (10Y 4.04%, -0.62% 1d), and confirming futures gains (ES +1.48%, NQ +2.58%) point to near-term upside. Confidence is tempered by mixed 7-day performance and a still-elevated 30-day VIX.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether tech leadership persists: Nasdaq Composite at 22,872.01 and Nasdaq futures at 24,933.5 are the tell for sustained risk-on. Follow-through in QQQ (+2.56% 1d) and semis/AI proxies would validate the growth bid, while a stall would risk handing leadership back to defensives. Monitor the volatility and rates nexus: VIX at 20.52 needs to stay subdued for the bounce to hold, and the 10Y at 4.04% should remain below last week’s 4.112 reference to keep financial conditions supportive. A simultaneous VIX uptick with a yield back-up would challenge the bullish bias. Gauge breadth and small-cap participation: the Russell 2000 closed at 2,414.28 and Russell futures at 2,417.30; continued small-cap strength would corroborate improving risk appetite. Also keep an eye on the US Dollar at 100.14 and crude at 58.72; a softer dollar and stable energy tape would be consistent with ongoing equity strength.
