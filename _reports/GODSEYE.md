  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Across spot equities, the tone is mildly risk-off with the S&P 500 down 0.74% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite off 0.76%, and the Russell 2000 lower by 0.75%, while the average index move is -0.74%. That said, all four U.S. benchmarks remain higher over 30 days (roughly +2.4% to +6.0%), indicating recent weakness is more of a pause after a strong month than a trend reversal, so risk appetite is consolidating rather than collapsing.",
      "Volatility and rates are only cautiously supportive: the VIX rose 4.33% on the day to 14.95, but it is still down 33.2% over 30 days, consistent with a low-stress backdrop despite the latest equity pullback. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up 0.80% on the day to 4.16% and is up about 0.73% over 30 days, a modest backup in yields that slightly pressures valuations but does not yet signal acute macro stress.",
      "Index futures point to some stabilization and a modest rebuilding of risk appetite since the close, with S&P futures up 0.43%, Nasdaq futures up 0.65%, Dow futures up 0.23%, and Russell futures up 0.43% over the last day. This positive futures tone, combined with still-muted absolute VIX and broadly higher 30-day returns across indices and futures (roughly +4% to +6.5%), suggests risk appetite has dipped short term but remains broadly intact."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mixed but generally stable. Breadth is slightly positive with 8 assets up and 7 down, even though the average major index fell about 0.74% on the day. The VIX remains low at 14.95 despite a 4.33% daily jump, and the 10-year yield is only modestly higher at 4.16%, indicating no major stress in either volatility or rates. Taken together, the market looks like it is digesting strong 30-day gains rather than entering a broadly unhealthy or dislocated phase.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, futures benchmarks are leading while cash indices lag, with Nasdaq futures up 0.65% and S&P futures up 0.43% versus the Nasdaq Composite down 0.76% and the S&P 500 down 0.74%. On the equity side, the Dow 30 was a relative outperformer at -0.63% versus the Russell 2000, which lagged with a 0.75% decline and an even weaker 7-day profile (-1.88%). Among ETFs, QQQ was a notable underperformer with a 1-day move of -0.83%, making large-cap growth/tech the clear laggard, while SPY was a milder loser at -0.74% and still slightly positive over the week.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "Macro positioning around the end of an "eventful, roller-coaster" 2025 with sizable gains is a key driver of the tape, as highlighted by coverage that Wall Street is wrapping the year with strong performance powered by the AI trade. This context naturally encourages some profit-taking and rebalancing, which aligns with the modest equity pullback (S&P 500 -0.74%, Nasdaq Composite -0.76%) and slight uptick in VIX (+4.33%), tilting the near-term tone modestly risk-off even as longer-term gains remain intact.",
      "The persistent AI and mega-cap narrative remains a core risk-on catalyst, with reports noting that the AI trade again powered markets and that investors are focused on AI and retail stock picks for 2026. This continued thematic interest helps support growth and tech-related benchmarks despite their latest daily declines (QQQ -0.83%, Nasdaq Composite -0.76%) and likely underpins the stronger 30-day returns for the Nasdaq futures (+4.18%) and QQQ (+1.90%), keeping the broader regime tilted toward risk-on over a multi-week horizon.",
      "Small caps and broader risk assets are being reframed by strategists as potential upside plays for 2026, with commentary suggesting small-caps are "set for upside" after being under the radar. That narrative is consistent with the Russell 2000's strong 30-day gain of 6.00% and Russell futures up 6.49% over 30 days, even though 7-day performance is softer (-1.88% cash, -2.57% futures), implying a tug-of-war between near-term caution and a constructive medium-term risk-on bias for higher-beta segments."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours are not explicitly detailed in the provided data, but one cited macro event is the release of Federal Reserve FOMC meeting minutes referenced in recent commentary about S&P futures trading cautiously ahead of that release; such minutes typically influence rate expectations and could sway equities either risk-on (if dovish) or risk-off (if hawkish). Beyond that, the context mainly points to year-end and early-2026 positioning narratives rather than specific scheduled earnings or data, so the near-term tape is likely to react more to positioning and flows than to clearly identified single-day catalysts in this dataset.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is modestly up, as all major equity futures are currently higher over the last day (S&P +0.43%, Nasdaq +0.65%, Dow +0.23%, Russell +0.43%) following a synchronous but moderate pullback in cash indices of about 0.7–0.8%. The VIX, while up 4.33% on the day, remains low in absolute terms at 14.95, and 30-day equity and futures returns are solidly positive, suggesting the prior session's weakness was more consolidation than the start of a sustained downtrend. With no clearly negative new macro shock in the provided news and an ongoing AI and small-cap upside narrative, futures pricing leans toward a mild risk-on rebound.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Traders should watch whether S&P futures can hold and extend gains above the latest 6,922 print and whether that translates into the S&P 500 cash index reclaiming some of yesterday's 0.74% loss. The Nasdaq complex deserves close attention, as Nasdaq futures are up 0.65% while the cash Nasdaq Composite fell 0.76%; if futures strength persists into the open, it would confirm dip-buying in growth and AI-exposed names after a weak day for QQQ (-0.83%).",
      "On the macro side, monitor the 10-year Treasury yield around its latest 4.16% level and the VIX near 15; a pullback in yields from the recent 0.80% 1-day rise and stabilization or softening in VIX from its 4.33% jump would support the anticipated mild rebound in equities. In terms of leadership, keep an eye on small caps via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which have the strongest 30-day performance (+6.00% and +6.49% respectively) but weaker 7-day trends, as renewed strength there would reinforce a broader risk-on tone consistent with the current positive bias in futures."
