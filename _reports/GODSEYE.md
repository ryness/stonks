  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities weakened broadly with the S&P 500 down 1.12%, Nasdaq Composite down 1.90%, Russell 2000 down 1.86%, and Dow 30 down 0.84% on the day, producing an average index decline of 1.44%. Over the past week, losses deepened (Nasdaq -3.25%, Russell -3.50%), though 30-day changes remain modestly positive for the S&P 500 (+1.75%) and Nasdaq (+2.99%). This points to fading risk appetite near term despite still constructive 30‑day performance.
  
  Volatility firmed as VIX rose to 19.65 (+0.77% 1d, +16.13% 7d, +28.52% 30d), signaling elevated hedging demand. Futures show a tentative stabilisation with S&P (+0.21%), Nasdaq (+0.29%), Dow (+0.14%), and Russell (+0.36%) up overnight, but the weekly trend remains lower across all four (-1.47% to -3.60%), keeping risk appetite fragile.
  
  Rates eased with the 10Y Treasury yield down 1.54% on the day to 4.09%, a typically supportive backdrop that was outweighed by equity weakness. Cross‑asset signals skew defensive as Gold gained 0.84% on the day and the US Dollar edged up 0.10%, while WTI rose 1.08% but remains down 8.60% over 30 days. Net‑net, risk appetite is fading even as futures attempt a small bounce.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is fragile. Breadth is mixed but slightly positive (8 up vs 7 down), yet the average index change was a notable -1.44% as large caps, growth, and small caps all fell. Volatility is elevated with VIX at 19.65 and up 16.13% over the week, while the 10Y yield eased to 4.09% (-1.54% 1d), suggesting defensive positioning despite easier rates. The combination implies a risk-off bias with pockets of resilience outside core equities.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed negative with the Nasdaq Composite the clear laggard at -1.90% 1d, closely followed by the Russell 2000 at -1.86%, while the Dow 30 held up best at -0.84% 1d. A positive standout was Gold Fut at +0.84% 1d. Over the week, the Russell 2000 (-3.50%) and Nasdaq (-3.25%) underperformed, while the Dow (-1.66%) relatively outpaced peers.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Tech/AI valuation concerns are a key overhang, with reports of global chip selloffs and high-profile bearish positioning in AI beneficiaries weighing on sentiment. Articles highlighting a $1.1 billion short against AI stocks and broader warnings about corrections have reinforced a risk-off tone, which aligns with the Nasdaq’s 1d decline of 1.90% and 7d drop of 3.25%. Cross‑regional sentiment remains sensitive to Big Tech moves, with coverage noting Asian markets reacting to U.S. tech turbulence. While some headlines point to attempted rebounds in Asia after intermittent Wall Street gains, the current setup shows only a cautious risk-on attempt in futures (ES +0.21%, NQ +0.29%), which is not yet strong enough to overturn the broader weekly declines. Additional risk signals include crypto ETF outflows amid macro jitters, reinforcing de‑risking across speculative assets, and governance headlines such as the Tesla pay package vote debate that can influence mega‑cap sentiment. These themes collectively skew near-term impact toward risk-off, consistent with the higher VIX (+16.13% 7d) and defensive bid in Gold.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Futures are modestly higher (ES +0.21%, NQ +0.29%, RTY +0.36%) following a weak cash session (avg index -1.44% 1d) with VIX elevated at 19.65 and weekly momentum negative. The 10Y yield easing to 4.09% offers some support, but tech and small-cap underperformance and risk-off macro headlines temper upside follow-through.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch volatility and core index levels for confirmation of stabilisation: VIX near the 20 threshold (last 19.65) and S&P 500 cash at 6,720.32 versus S&P futures at 6,762.00. Sustained trade with VIX under 20 alongside ES holding modest gains would support a flat-to-stable tape; a VIX push above 20 would risk renewed equity pressure. Monitor leadership in tech and small caps given their outsized 1d drops: Nasdaq Composite (-1.90% 1d, NQ=F last 25,316.75) and Russell 2000 (-1.86% 1d, RTY=F last 2,436.20). Stabilisation in NQ=F and RTY=F would help the broader market base; additional underperformance there would argue for defensiveness. Track macro proxies for risk tone: the 10Y yield at 4.09% (easing supportive), the US Dollar at 99.83 (further strength can tighten financial conditions), Gold at 4,013.30 (persistent bid signals de‑risking), and WTI at 60.07 (energy weakness over 30d reflects growth concerns). Shifts across these gauges should align with whether the futures’ tentative bounce can hold a flat session.
