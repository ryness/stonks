  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities closed broadly lower with the S&P 500 down 1.56%, Nasdaq Composite down 2.15%, Russell 2000 down 1.82%, and Dow 30 down 0.84% on the day, while 7-day declines of 4.50% to 6.23% underline persistent selling pressure and fading risk appetite. Volatility jumped as the VIX rose 11.67% to 26.42 on the day and 52.89% over the week, signaling elevated hedging demand.
  
  Overnight futures show a tentative rebound with S&P futures +0.35%, Nasdaq futures +0.19%, Dow futures +0.44%, and Russell futures +0.48%, but the rates and commodity backdrop remains cautious. The 10Y Treasury yield slipped 0.65% to 4.11% and WTI crude fell 1.69% on the day, suggesting a defensive tone even as futures attempt to stabilize.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market breadth is weak at 5 up vs 10 down, and the average 1-day index change is -1.71%, pointing to broad-based pressure. The VIX at 26.42 after an 11.67% daily spike reflects stressed conditions. A modest 0.65% decline in the 10Y yield to 4.11% offers limited support but has not stemmed equity losses. Overall health is poor with defensive undercurrents dominating.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, defensives led on a relative basis as the Dow 30 fell a smaller 0.84% while growth lagged with the Nasdaq Composite down 2.15% and QQQ down 2.37%. Overnight, futures lead the tentative bounce with Russell futures +0.48% and Dow futures +0.44% standing out on the positive side. Over the past week, small caps have been the notable laggard with the Russell 2000 down 6.23%, while no major U.S. cash index is positive for the period.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** An upbeat Nvidia outlook has been a key swing factor, with reports noting a strong forecast that calmed AI-bubble jitters and lifted Asian equities, supporting a risk-on response in tech proxies. This aligns with modest gains in U.S. index futures (ES +0.35%, NQ +0.19%) as investors reassess AI demand durability. Countering that, headlines highlight fading hopes for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts amid a spike in the VIX, contributing to global risk-off pressure. The defensive macro tone is echoed by a 1.69% drop in WTI crude and a firmer U.S. dollar over the week (+0.62%), dynamics that can dampen cyclicals and keep volatility elevated.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 58% Modest green in U.S. futures (ES +0.35%, NQ +0.19%, YM +0.44%, RTY +0.48%) alongside supportive Nvidia headlines tilt the next 24 hours toward a rebound, though elevated volatility (VIX 26.42, +11.67% 1d) and weak 7-day index performance (S&P -4.50%, Nasdaq -5.92%) cap confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures versus cash: S&P futures around 6,580 vs the S&P 500 last close at 6,538.76, and Nasdaq futures at 24,177 versus QQQ at 585.67, to gauge follow-through; sustained futures leadership would validate an early bounce. Monitor volatility and rates for confirmation: a drift lower from VIX 26.42 and steady-to-softer 10Y yields near 4.11 would support risk-on, while a re-spike would likely pressure high beta and small caps (Russell 2000 2,305.11; Russell futures 2,321.70). In tech, reactions tied to AI leadership remain pivotal given recent Nvidia-driven sentiment shifts. Keep an eye on oil and the dollar: further weakness in WTI at 58.14 and a firm dollar at 100.09 can weigh on cyclicals and earnings sensitivity, which may limit the breadth of any rebound.
