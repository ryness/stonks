  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across major US equity benchmarks, the tone is mildly negative in the very short term but still constructive over the past month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both slipped about 0.06% on the day, while the Dow fell 0.17%, yet all three remain higher over 30 days, with the Dow up 3.08% and the S&P 500 up 1.32%. Small caps are the standout on a trend basis, with the Russell 2000 up 0.12% on the day, 3.97% over a week, and 6.59% over 30 days, indicating that risk appetite had been improving beneath the surface even as large caps consolidate.
  
  Volatility and futures point to a sharp deterioration in near-term risk appetite despite the relatively small cash index moves. The VIX has jumped 19.36% on the day and more than 22% over the week to 18.93, signaling a meaningful bid for protection. S&P futures are down 1.08% on the day and Nasdaq futures are down 1.43%, with Dow and Russell futures lower by 0.84% and 1.28%, respectively, suggesting that overnight positioning has turned clearly risk-off relative to the prior cash close.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals reinforce this cautious tone. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 1.71% on the day and 4.29% over 30 days to 4.23%, pointing to persistent upward pressure on yields that can weigh on equity valuations. At the same time, gold futures are up 1.85% on the day and nearly 11% over 30 days, while the US dollar is modestly softer on the day, a combination consistent with demand for hedges and safe havens. Overall, risk appetite is fading in the very near term despite still-positive medium-term equity performance, with higher volatility, weaker futures, and rising yields quantifying that shift.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is fragile: breadth shows only 4 instruments up versus 11 down, and the average 1-day change across indices is a slight decline of about 0.06%. While headline US benchmarks are only marginally lower on the day and remain up over 30 days, the sharp 19% 1-day spike in the VIX and its 22.5% rise over the week indicate growing stress and hedging demand. The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed to 4.23%, up 1.7% on the day and over 4% in a month, tightening financial conditions at the margin. Taken together, the market looks late-cycle constructive but currently under pressure, with defensive undercurrents outweighing the modest index declines.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small caps are leading: the Russell 2000 gained 0.12%, and its futures are still up 1.46% over the week and 4.78% over 30 days, marking it as a medium-term outperformer. On the downside, Nasdaq-linked vehicles are lagging, with the QQQ ETF down 0.08% on the day and 0.44% over the week, and Nasdaq futures off 1.43% on both a 1-day and 7-day basis. The Dow 30 also underperformed on the day with a 0.17% decline, even though it remains the strongest large-cap index over 30 days with a 3.08% gain. This mix points to recent leadership from cyclicals and small caps and relative weakness in mega-cap tech and growth.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and sector-specific earnings themes are central to the current tape. On the positive side, strong earnings from TSMC revived AI confidence and drove a rebound in US equities earlier in the week, with chip stocks leading and the S&P 500 gaining 0.5% and the Nasdaq nearly 1% in that session, a classically risk-on catalyst. Similarly, Indian markets saw Infosys' upbeat Q3 results and guidance lift IT stocks and push benchmarks higher intraday, though profit-booking capped gains by the close, underscoring how earnings strength is being partially offset by a willingness to fade rallies. At the same time, global risk sentiment is being tempered by mixed cues and ongoing geopolitical and macro uncertainties cited in several international market recaps. Indian commentators highlight foreign institutional investor selling, limited near-term triggers, and geopolitical tensions as reasons for cautious broader sentiment despite localized earnings-driven pops, all of which align with the current rise in VIX and bid for gold as risk-off hedges. US commentary notes that recent stock gains have come alongside climbing bond yields, with the 10-year at 4.23%, creating a push-pull between AI- and earnings-driven optimism and valuation pressure from higher rates. In crypto and alternative assets, modestly positive digital asset performance and growing institutional focus on Bitcoin options and structural narratives suggest a parallel search for returns and diversification outside traditional equities. However, the more immediate macro read is from gold and Treasuries: gold's 1.85% 1-day and nearly 11% 30-day surge, combined with higher yields, indicates investors are simultaneously hedging growth and inflation risks. This combination makes the equity tape more sensitive to any macro disappointment, skewing the impact of new information toward risk-off reactions even when some micro data points, like select earnings, are positive.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete next-24-hour triggers in the provided data are not specified by name, but the news flow highlights that upcoming corporate earnings, especially in AI- and chip-related names following TSMC, remain a key potential mover for indices by reinforcing or challenging the recent AI-driven rebound narrative. Indian market previews explicitly frame Infosys' results as a driver for broader IT and benchmark moves, implying that additional large-cap earnings in that market could swing regional risk sentiment and spill over into global risk-taking. US commentary emphasizes that bond yields and macro data releases in general are in focus, so any new US economic prints that affect the 10-year yield path could disproportionately impact valuations in growth sectors and index futures. Overall, traders should expect earnings releases and any scheduled US data impacting yields or inflation expectations to be the primary catalysts within the next 24 hours.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence – The dominant near-term signals are risk-off: VIX is up 19.36% on the day and more than 22% over the week, S&P futures are down 1.08% and Nasdaq futures down 1.43% versus only ~0.06% declines in the cash indices, pointing to worsening sentiment into the next session. The 10-year yield has risen to 4.23% with a 1.7% 1-day increase and over 4% gain in a month, putting additional pressure on equity valuations, especially tech, where QQQ is down both on the day and over the week and Nasdaq futures are negative across 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day windows. Although small caps and the Dow show positive 30-day trends and AI-related earnings have recently provided support, the combination of weak futures, higher volatility, and rising yields outweighs these supports, skewing the expected next 24-hour direction modestly to the downside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should closely monitor index futures levels and whether the current S&P futures loss of about 1.08% and Nasdaq futures loss of 1.43% deepen or retrace, as these will set the opening tone and confirm or challenge the current risk-off bias. The Russell 2000, up 3.97% over a week and 6.59% over 30 days, will be an important tell: if Russell futures, currently down 1.28% on the day but still higher over 7 and 30 days, stabilize or rebound, it would suggest underlying risk appetite is holding; a further breakdown would signal broader de-risking beyond mega-cap tech. Watch QQQ and Nasdaq Composite behavior relative to these futures, given their recent underperformance and sensitivity to both AI earnings sentiment and higher yields. Macro-wise, attention should stay on the behavior of the 10-year Treasury yield around the 4.23% area and the VIX near 19, as further upside in yields or volatility would likely reinforce downside pressure on equities over the next 24 hours. The strong bid in gold, up 1.85% on the day and nearly 11% over 30 days, and the softening US dollar suggest that flows are migrating toward hedges; sustained or accelerating gains in gold would confirm that defensive positioning is still building. Sector-wise, chip and AI-related names are key: any new earnings or guidance updates in that space, following the TSMC and Infosys-driven optimism noted in the news, could either partially offset the risk-off tone if positive or exacerbate it if they disappoint, especially for Nasdaq-linked benchmarks.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Across major US equity benchmarks, the tone is mildly negative in the very short term but still constructive over the past month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both slipped about 0.06% on the day, while the Dow fell 0.17%, yet all three remain higher over 30 days, with the Dow up 3.08% and the S&P 500 up 1.32%. Small caps are the standout on a trend basis, with the Russell 2000 up 0.12% on the day, 3.97% over a week, and 6.59% over 30 days, indicating that risk appetite had been improving beneath the surface even as large caps consolidate.

Volatility and futures point to a sharp deterioration in near-term risk appetite despite the relatively small cash index moves. The VIX has jumped 19.36% on the day and more than 22% over the week to 18.93, signaling a meaningful bid for protection. S&P futures are down 1.08% on the day and Nasdaq futures are down 1.43%, with Dow and Russell futures lower by 0.84% and 1.28%, respectively, suggesting that overnight positioning has turned clearly risk-off relative to the prior cash close.

Rates and cross-asset signals reinforce this cautious tone. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 1.71% on the day and 4.29% over 30 days to 4.23%, pointing to persistent upward pressure on yields that can weigh on equity valuations. At the same time, gold futures are up 1.85% on the day and nearly 11% over 30 days, while the US dollar is modestly softer on the day, a combination consistent with demand for hedges and safe havens. Overall, risk appetite is fading in the very near term despite still-positive medium-term equity performance, with higher volatility, weaker futures, and rising yields quantifying that shift.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is fragile: breadth shows only 4 instruments up versus 11 down, and the average 1-day change across indices is a slight decline of about 0.06%. While headline US benchmarks are only marginally lower on the day and remain up over 30 days, the sharp 19% 1-day spike in the VIX and its 22.5% rise over the week indicate growing stress and hedging demand. The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed to 4.23%, up 1.7% on the day and over 4% in a month, tightening financial conditions at the margin. Taken together, the market looks late-cycle constructive but currently under pressure, with defensive undercurrents outweighing the modest index declines.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small caps are leading: the Russell 2000 gained 0.12%, and its futures are still up 1.46% over the week and 4.78% over 30 days, marking it as a medium-term outperformer. On the downside, Nasdaq-linked vehicles are lagging, with the QQQ ETF down 0.08% on the day and 0.44% over the week, and Nasdaq futures off 1.43% on both a 1-day and 7-day basis. The Dow 30 also underperformed on the day with a 0.17% decline, even though it remains the strongest large-cap index over 30 days with a 3.08% gain. This mix points to recent leadership from cyclicals and small caps and relative weakness in mega-cap tech and growth.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and sector-specific earnings themes are central to the current tape. On the positive side, strong earnings from TSMC revived AI confidence and drove a rebound in US equities earlier in the week, with chip stocks leading and the S&P 500 gaining 0.5% and the Nasdaq nearly 1% in that session, a classically risk-on catalyst. Similarly, Indian markets saw Infosys' upbeat Q3 results and guidance lift IT stocks and push benchmarks higher intraday, though profit-booking capped gains by the close, underscoring how earnings strength is being partially offset by a willingness to fade rallies. At the same time, global risk sentiment is being tempered by mixed cues and ongoing geopolitical and macro uncertainties cited in several international market recaps. Indian commentators highlight foreign institutional investor selling, limited near-term triggers, and geopolitical tensions as reasons for cautious broader sentiment despite localized earnings-driven pops, all of which align with the current rise in VIX and bid for gold as risk-off hedges. US commentary notes that recent stock gains have come alongside climbing bond yields, with the 10-year at 4.23%, creating a push-pull between AI- and earnings-driven optimism and valuation pressure from higher rates. In crypto and alternative assets, modestly positive digital asset performance and growing institutional focus on Bitcoin options and structural narratives suggest a parallel search for returns and diversification outside traditional equities. However, the more immediate macro read is from gold and Treasuries: gold's 1.85% 1-day and nearly 11% 30-day surge, combined with higher yields, indicates investors are simultaneously hedging growth and inflation risks. This combination makes the equity tape more sensitive to any macro disappointment, skewing the impact of new information toward risk-off reactions even when some micro data points, like select earnings, are positive.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete next-24-hour triggers in the provided data are not specified by name, but the news flow highlights that upcoming corporate earnings, especially in AI- and chip-related names following TSMC, remain a key potential mover for indices by reinforcing or challenging the recent AI-driven rebound narrative. Indian market previews explicitly frame Infosys' results as a driver for broader IT and benchmark moves, implying that additional large-cap earnings in that market could swing regional risk sentiment and spill over into global risk-taking. US commentary emphasizes that bond yields and macro data releases in general are in focus, so any new US economic prints that affect the 10-year yield path could disproportionately impact valuations in growth sectors and index futures. Overall, traders should expect earnings releases and any scheduled US data impacting yields or inflation expectations to be the primary catalysts within the next 24 hours.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence – The dominant near-term signals are risk-off: VIX is up 19.36% on the day and more than 22% over the week, S&P futures are down 1.08% and Nasdaq futures down 1.43% versus only ~0.06% declines in the cash indices, pointing to worsening sentiment into the next session. The 10-year yield has risen to 4.23% with a 1.7% 1-day increase and over 4% gain in a month, putting additional pressure on equity valuations, especially tech, where QQQ is down both on the day and over the week and Nasdaq futures are negative across 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day windows. Although small caps and the Dow show positive 30-day trends and AI-related earnings have recently provided support, the combination of weak futures, higher volatility, and rising yields outweighs these supports, skewing the expected next 24-hour direction modestly to the downside.

3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should closely monitor index futures levels and whether the current S&P futures loss of about 1.08% and Nasdaq futures loss of 1.43% deepen or retrace, as these will set the opening tone and confirm or challenge the current risk-off bias. The Russell 2000, up 3.97% over a week and 6.59% over 30 days, will be an important tell: if Russell futures, currently down 1.28% on the day but still higher over 7 and 30 days, stabilize or rebound, it would suggest underlying risk appetite is holding; a further breakdown would signal broader de-risking beyond mega-cap tech. Watch QQQ and Nasdaq Composite behavior relative to these futures, given their recent underperformance and sensitivity to both AI earnings sentiment and higher yields. Macro-wise, attention should stay on the behavior of the 10-year Treasury yield around the 4.23% area and the VIX near 19, as further upside in yields or volatility would likely reinforce downside pressure on equities over the next 24 hours. The strong bid in gold, up 1.85% on the day and nearly 11% over 30 days, and the softening US dollar suggest that flows are migrating toward hedges; sustained or accelerating gains in gold would confirm that defensive positioning is still building. Sector-wise, chip and AI-related names are key: any new earnings or guidance updates in that space, following the TSMC and Infosys-driven optimism noted in the news, could either partially offset the risk-off tone if positive or exacerbate it if they disappoint, especially for Nasdaq-linked benchmarks.

LLM raw output (truncated): {\n  &quot;1.0&quot;: [\n    &quot;Across major US equity benchmarks, the tone is mildly negative in the very short term but still constructive over the past month. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both slipped about 0.06% on the day, while the Dow fell 0.17%, yet all three remain higher over 30 days, with the Dow up 3.08% and the S&amp;P 500 up 1.32%. Small caps are the standout on a trend basis, with the Russell 2000 up 0.12% on the day, 3.97% over a week, and 6.59% over 30 days, indicating that risk appetite had been improving beneath the surface even as large caps consolidate.&quot;,\n    &quot;Volatility and futures
