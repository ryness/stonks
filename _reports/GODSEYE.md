  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities were mixed with the S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%, while the average index change was a marginal -0.05% and breadth was slightly positive at 9 up vs 6 down, indicating stabilization rather than strength. Risk appetite is tentative on the day but has faded over the week, as shown by the S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, and Russell 2000 -3.11% over 7 days.
  
  Volatility eased intraday with the VIX -0.85% to 19.83 but remains elevated versus recent history with a 7-day gain of 10.11% and a 30-day rise of 19.10%, signaling lingering risk aversion. Equity futures show a modest positive tilt led by tech and small caps (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%) while Dow futures lag (YM -0.58%), reflecting a cautious, selective risk-on tone.
  
  Rates are a headwind with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15, and the US dollar edged +0.09% on the day as commodities diverged with WTI crude +2.15% and gold -2.45%. These cross-asset moves point to a cautious backdrop despite the modest equity futures bid.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral to cautious. Breadth was modestly positive at 9 up vs 6 down, but the average index change was a slight decline of -0.05%, signaling limited improvement. Volatility is still elevated with VIX at 19.83 and up 10.11% over 7 days, and the 10Y yield moved up to 4.15 (+0.88% today), both constraining risk appetite. Overall, conditions appear stable but not robust given the weak 7-day equity profile.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow was a clear laggard at -0.65%. Over the past week, small caps and tech underperformed materially (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq Composite -2.55%), whereas the Dow was the relative leader at -0.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global headlines highlight pressure from a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy, aligning with the 7-day declines in the Nasdaq Composite (-2.55%) and Nasdaq futures (-2.33%), a combination that tilts risk-off by undermining growth leadership. Reports of an unprecedented slump in investment in China and Beijing’s ‘extreme disappointment’ with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip supply-chain row add macro and geopolitical uncertainty, a setup that can weigh on semiconductors and cyclicals and is consistent with the Russell 2000’s 7-day drop of 3.11% and the VIX’s 10.11% rise over the week. US narratives of valuation concerns after Wall Street’s worst day in a month reinforce caution, even as today’s modest rebound in QQQ (+0.08%) and NQ futures (+0.21%) suggests only tentative risk-on attempts rather than a durable shift.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — Futures are slightly positive (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%) and the VIX eased 0.85% today, but elevated weekly volatility (+10.11%), a 10Y yield uptick to 4.15 (+0.88%), and weak 7-day equity momentum (S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, Russell -3.11%) argue for a contained range rather than a trend move.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures marks for confirmation of tone: S&P 500 futures near 6,765, Nasdaq futures around 25,147, and Russell futures at 2,399; holding or building above these levels would support a tentative tech/small-cap bid, while slips back would reinforce the recent weekly downtrend. Monitor volatility and rates as primary constraints: VIX near 19.83 with 20 as a psychological pivot and the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15; a VIX push back above 20 or further yield firmness would likely pressure the Dow, which already lagged today at -0.65%. Track rotation cues: small caps after a 7-day slide of 3.00% in Russell futures, energy with WTI up 2.15% to 59.95, and gold weakness (-2.45% to 4,084.40) as barometers of risk preference into the next session.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-14T23:27:05.466638+00:00">2025-11-14 23:27 UTC</time> (runtime 2m 21s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities were mixed with the S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%, while the average index change was a marginal -0.05% and breadth was slightly positive at 9 up vs 6 down, indicating stabilization rather than strength. Risk appetite is tentative on the day but has faded over the week, as shown by the S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, and Russell 2000 -3.11% over 7 days.

Volatility eased intraday with the VIX -0.85% to 19.83 but remains elevated versus recent history with a 7-day gain of 10.11% and a 30-day rise of 19.10%, signaling lingering risk aversion. Equity futures show a modest positive tilt led by tech and small caps (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%) while Dow futures lag (YM -0.58%), reflecting a cautious, selective risk-on tone.

Rates are a headwind with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15, and the US dollar edged +0.09% on the day as commodities diverged with WTI crude +2.15% and gold -2.45%. These cross-asset moves point to a cautious backdrop despite the modest equity futures bid.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral to cautious. Breadth was modestly positive at 9 up vs 6 down, but the average index change was a slight decline of -0.05%, signaling limited improvement. Volatility is still elevated with VIX at 19.83 and up 10.11% over 7 days, and the 10Y yield moved up to 4.15 (+0.88% today), both constraining risk appetite. Overall, conditions appear stable but not robust given the weak 7-day equity profile.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow was a clear laggard at -0.65%. Over the past week, small caps and tech underperformed materially (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq Composite -2.55%), whereas the Dow was the relative leader at -0.35%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global headlines highlight pressure from a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy, aligning with the 7-day declines in the Nasdaq Composite (-2.55%) and Nasdaq futures (-2.33%), a combination that tilts risk-off by undermining growth leadership. Reports of an unprecedented slump in investment in China and Beijing’s ‘extreme disappointment’ with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip supply-chain row add macro and geopolitical uncertainty, a setup that can weigh on semiconductors and cyclicals and is consistent with the Russell 2000’s 7-day drop of 3.11% and the VIX’s 10.11% rise over the week. US narratives of valuation concerns after Wall Street’s worst day in a month reinforce caution, even as today’s modest rebound in QQQ (+0.08%) and NQ futures (+0.21%) suggests only tentative risk-on attempts rather than a durable shift.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — Futures are slightly positive (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%) and the VIX eased 0.85% today, but elevated weekly volatility (+10.11%), a 10Y yield uptick to 4.15 (+0.88%), and weak 7-day equity momentum (S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, Russell -3.11%) argue for a contained range rather than a trend move.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures marks for confirmation of tone: S&P 500 futures near 6,765, Nasdaq futures around 25,147, and Russell futures at 2,399; holding or building above these levels would support a tentative tech/small-cap bid, while slips back would reinforce the recent weekly downtrend. Monitor volatility and rates as primary constraints: VIX near 19.83 with 20 as a psychological pivot and the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15; a VIX push back above 20 or further yield firmness would likely pressure the Dow, which already lagged today at -0.65%. Track rotation cues: small caps after a 7-day slide of 3.00% in Russell futures, energy with WTI up 2.15% to 59.95, and gold weakness (-2.45% to 4,084.40) as barometers of risk preference into the next session.
