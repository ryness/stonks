  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a mildly constructive but uneven tone, with an average 1d index gain of about 0.23% and 8 of 15 tracked instruments higher on the day. The Russell 2000 leads with a 1.18% jump and the Dow adds 0.10%, while the S&P 500 is barely positive at +0.05% and the Nasdaq Composite slips 0.22%, indicating some rotation toward small caps and cyclicals rather than broad, high-conviction buying. Risk appetite on the cash session looks modestly improved but not decisive given that key growth benchmarks remain negative over 7–30 days.
  
  Volatility and futures point to a more cautious undercurrent, tempering the risk-on read from cash markets. The VIX is elevated at 21.2 and rose 2.9% on the day and 46% over 30 days, while S&P and Nasdaq futures are currently down 0.49% and 0.83% on the day, respectively, and Russell futures are off 0.87%, signaling weaker risk appetite in the forward-looking tape than the last cash close suggests. At the same time, the 10Y Treasury yield has fallen 5.1% over the week to 4.06%, a move that usually supports risk assets but here coincides with a softening in equity futures, leaving the overall tone as cautiously risk-off in the near term despite modest gains in spot indices.
  
  Cross-asset signals are mixed, with commodities and FX not clearly reinforcing a strong risk-on or risk-off regime. Crude oil is higher by 0.78% on the day and up 10.6% over 30 days, consistent with better cyclical expectations, while gold is off 2.4% on the day but still up 13.7% over 30 days, implying persistent demand for hedges. The US dollar is modestly stronger on the day (+0.25%) but weaker over the week and month, so on balance the quantified metrics suggest risk appetite has improved slightly versus recent sessions but is fading into the overnight as higher volatility and weaker futures dominate.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately stable but not robust. Breadth is slightly positive with 8 instruments up and 7 down, and the average 1d index move of roughly +0.23% points to a gentle bid rather than a strong advance. Elevated VIX at 21.2, up nearly 46% over 30 days, signals that underlying stress and demand for protection remain significant. The decline in the 10Y Treasury yield to 4.06% over the last week offers some support to valuations, but taken together the data suggest a market that is functioning and not dislocated, yet still in a cautious, volatility-aware phase rather than a clean bill of health.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear equity leader with a 1.18% gain, while the Dow also outperforms with a 0.10% rise, signaling relative strength in small caps and blue chips. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite lags with a 0.22% decline and its associated futures are off 0.83%, highlighting continued pressure on growth and tech. Over the past week, the Russell complex remains a standout with Russell futures up 1.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite is the notable laggard with a 1.56% weekly drop, confirming that leadership has rotated away from large-cap growth toward smaller and more cyclical names.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and geopolitical drivers are relatively muted in the very near term due to the US holiday closure, with Presidents Day keeping US stock and bond markets shut and focusing attention on futures and international flows. This trading pause limits fresh price discovery in cash markets and tends to suppress immediate macro-driven moves, favoring a more range-bound or position-adjustment tone rather than directional risk-on or risk-off behavior. As a result, the main observable impulses are coming from how futures and non-US markets digest existing information rather than new US data or policy news. Recent global equity commentary highlights strong performance in tech and chip stocks and optimism in Asian markets tied to political developments and stimulus expectations, which has helped support risk sentiment earlier in the week. Articles noting that tech stocks fueled gains and that Asian markets rallied on hopes of enhanced Japanese economic stimulus point to a still-present global risk-on backdrop, particularly for growth and cyclicals, even though US Nasdaq benchmarks have underperformed over the last 7–30 days. This divergence suggests that while macro optimism exists internationally, US investors remain more selective, generating a mixed impact on risk appetite. Other thematic coverage points to investors' focus on earnings season dynamics, inflation trends, and upcoming labor data, as referenced in pre-market setup pieces and discussions of futures reacting to anticipated job reports. These narratives imply that positioning is increasingly data-dependent, with potential for sharp swings in risk appetite around macro releases even if none hit during the US holiday itself. In this environment, the elevated VIX and firm gold and crude over 30 days underscore that macro uncertainty is still biasing markets toward hedging and tactical rather than outright risk-on positioning.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the key triggers are the resumption of regular US trading following the Presidents Day closure and any scheduled economic data or corporate earnings releases linked to that reopening, as suggested by prior coverage of investors reacting to jobs data and earnings-focused pre-market reports. Futures markets in S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell, which are already showing declines of 0.35% to 0.87% on the day, will likely be the first to reflect market response to any overnight global developments or macro headlines. Additionally, global sessions, particularly in Asia and Europe where recent reports highlight sensitivity to inflation, trade, and policy news, could set the tone for US indices when they reopen by influencing risk sentiment and cross-asset flows.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all currently negative on the day, with Nasdaq and Russell futures down 0.83% and 0.87%, indicating a weaker tone heading into the next session despite small gains in the prior US cash close. The elevated VIX at 21.2, up nearly 3% on the day and 46% over 30 days, further supports a defensive bias. While lower 10Y yields and earlier strength in small caps provide some offset, the combination of broad futures softness and persistent volatility suggests a modestly higher probability of downside in the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch how S&P futures behave around the recent 6,800–6,850 zone and whether the current 0.49% decline deepens or stabilizes as cash markets reopen. Sustained weakness in Nasdaq futures, already down 0.83%, would confirm ongoing pressure on growth and tech and could weigh on QQQ and the Nasdaq Composite, especially given their negative 7–30 day performance. Monitoring VIX near 21 is critical; a push materially higher would indicate that hedging demand is accelerating and would align with the projected downside bias. Sector-wise, the relative resilience of small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.18% on the last cash day and Russell futures still higher over 7 and 30 days, should be tracked to see if they continue to outperform or start to roll over in line with the weaker overnight futures tape. On the macro side, moves in the 10Y yield around the 4.0–4.1% area and in gold and crude—gold down sharply on the day but up strongly over 30 days, and crude up more than 10% over a month—will help gauge whether investors are adding to hedges or repositioning toward cyclicals. Any shift in these cross-asset signals during Asian and European hours will be an important tell for whether the expected downside in US equities is likely to be shallow and tactical or more broad-based. Overnight, traders should also watch the US dollar index near 97, as its modest 1d rise against a softer 7–30 day backdrop will influence global risk appetite and commodities. If the dollar strengthens further alongside falling equity futures, it would reinforce a risk-off narrative and pressure emerging markets and cyclicals. Conversely, a pullback in the dollar combined with stabilization in futures could temper the downside case, so intraday correlations between DXY, equity futures, and VIX will be key signals into the next US session.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

## 1. Pulse

Equities show a mildly constructive but uneven tone, with an average 1d index gain of about 0.23% and 8 of 15 tracked instruments higher on the day. The Russell 2000 leads with a 1.18% jump and the Dow adds 0.10%, while the S&P 500 is barely positive at +0.05% and the Nasdaq Composite slips 0.22%, indicating some rotation toward small caps and cyclicals rather than broad, high-conviction buying. Risk appetite on the cash session looks modestly improved but not decisive given that key growth benchmarks remain negative over 7–30 days.

Volatility and futures point to a more cautious undercurrent, tempering the risk-on read from cash markets. The VIX is elevated at 21.2 and rose 2.9% on the day and 46% over 30 days, while S&P and Nasdaq futures are currently down 0.49% and 0.83% on the day, respectively, and Russell futures are off 0.87%, signaling weaker risk appetite in the forward-looking tape than the last cash close suggests. At the same time, the 10Y Treasury yield has fallen 5.1% over the week to 4.06%, a move that usually supports risk assets but here coincides with a softening in equity futures, leaving the overall tone as cautiously risk-off in the near term despite modest gains in spot indices.

Cross-asset signals are mixed, with commodities and FX not clearly reinforcing a strong risk-on or risk-off regime. Crude oil is higher by 0.78% on the day and up 10.6% over 30 days, consistent with better cyclical expectations, while gold is off 2.4% on the day but still up 13.7% over 30 days, implying persistent demand for hedges. The US dollar is modestly stronger on the day (+0.25%) but weaker over the week and month, so on balance the quantified metrics suggest risk appetite has improved slightly versus recent sessions but is fading into the overnight as higher volatility and weaker futures dominate.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately stable but not robust. Breadth is slightly positive with 8 instruments up and 7 down, and the average 1d index move of roughly +0.23% points to a gentle bid rather than a strong advance. Elevated VIX at 21.2, up nearly 46% over 30 days, signals that underlying stress and demand for protection remain significant. The decline in the 10Y Treasury yield to 4.06% over the last week offers some support to valuations, but taken together the data suggest a market that is functioning and not dislocated, yet still in a cautious, volatility-aware phase rather than a clean bill of health.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear equity leader with a 1.18% gain, while the Dow also outperforms with a 0.10% rise, signaling relative strength in small caps and blue chips. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite lags with a 0.22% decline and its associated futures are off 0.83%, highlighting continued pressure on growth and tech. Over the past week, the Russell complex remains a standout with Russell futures up 1.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite is the notable laggard with a 1.56% weekly drop, confirming that leadership has rotated away from large-cap growth toward smaller and more cyclical names.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and geopolitical drivers are relatively muted in the very near term due to the US holiday closure, with Presidents Day keeping US stock and bond markets shut and focusing attention on futures and international flows. This trading pause limits fresh price discovery in cash markets and tends to suppress immediate macro-driven moves, favoring a more range-bound or position-adjustment tone rather than directional risk-on or risk-off behavior. As a result, the main observable impulses are coming from how futures and non-US markets digest existing information rather than new US data or policy news. Recent global equity commentary highlights strong performance in tech and chip stocks and optimism in Asian markets tied to political developments and stimulus expectations, which has helped support risk sentiment earlier in the week. Articles noting that tech stocks fueled gains and that Asian markets rallied on hopes of enhanced Japanese economic stimulus point to a still-present global risk-on backdrop, particularly for growth and cyclicals, even though US Nasdaq benchmarks have underperformed over the last 7–30 days. This divergence suggests that while macro optimism exists internationally, US investors remain more selective, generating a mixed impact on risk appetite. Other thematic coverage points to investors' focus on earnings season dynamics, inflation trends, and upcoming labor data, as referenced in pre-market setup pieces and discussions of futures reacting to anticipated job reports. These narratives imply that positioning is increasingly data-dependent, with potential for sharp swings in risk appetite around macro releases even if none hit during the US holiday itself. In this environment, the elevated VIX and firm gold and crude over 30 days underscore that macro uncertainty is still biasing markets toward hedging and tactical rather than outright risk-on positioning.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the key triggers are the resumption of regular US trading following the Presidents Day closure and any scheduled economic data or corporate earnings releases linked to that reopening, as suggested by prior coverage of investors reacting to jobs data and earnings-focused pre-market reports. Futures markets in S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell, which are already showing declines of 0.35% to 0.87% on the day, will likely be the first to reflect market response to any overnight global developments or macro headlines. Additionally, global sessions, particularly in Asia and Europe where recent reports highlight sensitivity to inflation, trade, and policy news, could set the tone for US indices when they reopen by influencing risk sentiment and cross-asset flows.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all currently negative on the day, with Nasdaq and Russell futures down 0.83% and 0.87%, indicating a weaker tone heading into the next session despite small gains in the prior US cash close. The elevated VIX at 21.2, up nearly 3% on the day and 46% over 30 days, further supports a defensive bias. While lower 10Y yields and earlier strength in small caps provide some offset, the combination of broad futures softness and persistent volatility suggests a modestly higher probability of downside in the next 24 hours.

3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch how S&P futures behave around the recent 6,800–6,850 zone and whether the current 0.49% decline deepens or stabilizes as cash markets reopen. Sustained weakness in Nasdaq futures, already down 0.83%, would confirm ongoing pressure on growth and tech and could weigh on QQQ and the Nasdaq Composite, especially given their negative 7–30 day performance. Monitoring VIX near 21 is critical; a push materially higher would indicate that hedging demand is accelerating and would align with the projected downside bias. Sector-wise, the relative resilience of small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.18% on the last cash day and Russell futures still higher over 7 and 30 days, should be tracked to see if they continue to outperform or start to roll over in line with the weaker overnight futures tape. On the macro side, moves in the 10Y yield around the 4.0–4.1% area and in gold and crude—gold down sharply on the day but up strongly over 30 days, and crude up more than 10% over a month—will help gauge whether investors are adding to hedges or repositioning toward cyclicals. Any shift in these cross-asset signals during Asian and European hours will be an important tell for whether the expected downside in US equities is likely to be shallow and tactical or more broad-based. Overnight, traders should also watch the US dollar index near 97, as its modest 1d rise against a softer 7–30 day backdrop will influence global risk appetite and commodities. If the dollar strengthens further alongside falling equity futures, it would reinforce a risk-off narrative and pressure emerging markets and cyclicals. Conversely, a pullback in the dollar combined with stabilization in futures could temper the downside case, so intraday correlations between DXY, equity futures, and VIX will be key signals into the next US session.
