  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities closed mixed-to-slightly positive, with the S&P 500 up 0.13%, Dow up 0.16%, Russell 2000 up 0.58%, and Nasdaq Composite down 0.21%; breadth ran 9 up, 5 down, and 1 flat, and the average index change was a modest +0.07%. Volatility eased on the day (VIX -2.15% to 19.08) but remains elevated versus last week (+12.77%) and month (+24.79%), indicating risk appetite is stabilizing today but remains fragile on a multi-day view.
  
  Futures show the same rotation: S&P (+0.09%), Dow (+0.12%), and Russell (+0.54%) were firmer while Nasdaq (-0.31%) lagged, consistent with pressure in growth/AI. Rates were unchanged on the day (10Y at 4.09%, +0.86% w/w), the dollar dipped 0.13%, gold rose 0.49%, and crude added 0.54% on the day but is down 9.08% over 30d; overall, risk appetite is mixed—improving intraday in cyclicals/small caps, but fading over the week with major indices down 1.35%–3.98%.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously neutral. Breadth favored gainers (9 up, 5 down, 1 flat) but the average index move was only +0.07%, reflecting tentative buying. The VIX at 19.08 fell 2.15% today yet is still up 12.77% over the week, and the 10Y yield held at 4.09% (+0.86% w/w), tempering risk appetite. Together this points to stabilization rather than robust risk-on.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, the Russell 2000 led with +0.58% while the Nasdaq Composite lagged at -0.21%. Over the week, tech-heavy benchmarks were the weakest with QQQ -4.09% and the Nasdaq Composite -3.98%, whereas the Dow held up best at -1.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A tech-led de-risking remains the primary macro theme, with multiple reports highlighting a Big Tech/AI valuation shakeout and a global chip selloff; this aligns with the Nasdaq’s underperformance today (-0.21%) and the 7d decline in Nasdaq futures (-4.17%), reinforcing a risk-off tilt within growth. Energy and commodities are another driver: crude is on track for a weekly loss amid oversupply fears while gold is firmer; WTI is down 9.08% over 30d and gold is up 5.94%, a pattern that can be modestly supportive for broader equities ex-Energy but consistent with a safety bid, leaving the overall risk tone mixed.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** China October trade data (CNBC) — a read on global demand and commodities that could sway cyclicals; Asia session follow-through on the AI/Big Tech sell-off (Yahoo Finance/CNBC) — sets the early tone for US futures; US consumer sentiment (Schwab) — a surprise could move yields, volatility, and discretionary risk.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — Mixed equity/futures tone (S&P +0.13%, ES +0.09%, Russell +0.58% vs Nasdaq -0.21%/-0.31%) and a day-over-day VIX dip to 19.08 are offset by still-elevated weekly VIX (+12.77%) and weak 7d returns (-1.35% to -3.98%), while the 10Y is steady at 4.09%; these cross-currents suggest a sideways bias into imminent data.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P futures can hold near 6,753.75 and if Nasdaq futures at 25,166.25 stabilize relative to Russell futures at 2,440.60; continued NQ underperformance would keep the broader tape heavy even if RTY outperforms. Monitor the VIX around 19.08 for confirmation—stability near or below this level would favor a grind, while an uptick would argue for more chop. Track macro and cross-asset tells: China trade data and Asia session tone; the 10Y at 4.09% for any push higher that could pressure growth; WTI near 59.75 and gold around 3,999.40 as gauges of inflation and hedging demand; and the US dollar at 99.60 for confirmation of risk appetite.
