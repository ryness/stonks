  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite improved on the day as equities rallied broadly: S&P 500 +1.33%, Nasdaq Composite +1.43%, and Russell 2000 +3.12%, with market breadth showing 11 up vs 4 down and an average index gain of 1.28%. The Dow 30 was the notable laggard at -0.84%, but futures also pointed higher into the next session with S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures all up about 1.41% and Russell futures up 3.13%.
  
  Volatility eased but remains elevated: VIX fell 11.88% to 23.28 on the day, though it is still up 32.95% over the week and 7.48% over the month, signaling that today’s risk-on tone is a rebound within a higher-vol regime. The drop in vol alongside equity strength indicates improving risk appetite today, but the elevated absolute VIX level tempers conviction.
  
  Rates were supportive with the 10Y Treasury yield down 1.05% to 4.06%, aiding equity multiples, while the US Dollar was little changed on the day (+0.02%). Commodities were mixed, with gold +0.62% and WTI crude -2.10%, the latter potentially weighing on energy but easing inflation concerns. Overall, the combination of higher equities, lower vol day-over-day, firmer futures, and softer yields points to an improving near-term risk tone.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks constructive near-term: breadth was positive at 11 up vs 4 down and the average index change was +1.28% today. The VIX fell 11.88% to 23.28, but remains elevated versus last week (+32.95% 7d), suggesting improved yet still fragile sentiment. The 10Y Treasury yield declined 1.05% to 4.06%, a supportive backdrop for equities. Taken together, the tape shows a healthy bounce with better breadth and friendlier rates, constrained by still-high volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 3.12% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.43%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.84%. Over the past week, laggards were tech-tilted benchmarks with QQQ down 4.43% and the Nasdaq Composite down 4.32%, and the Dow 30 down 4.54%. There were few weekly equity leaders; the US Dollar was a relative outperformer at +0.71% over 7 days.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Nvidia’s strong earnings and guidance have been a key catalyst, with multiple reports noting that results fueled a rally in global technology stocks and boosted US futures. This has translated into a risk-on impulse centered in tech, reflected in today’s Nasdaq strength (+1.43%) and QQQ’s rebound (+1.35% 1d), even as the broader tape had recently been pressured over the week. Markets are also eyeing the long-delayed September US jobs report, which has been flagged in coverage as a pending driver of risk sentiment. In parallel, recent Federal Reserve commentary warned that further rate cuts carry risks, and the VIX remains elevated on a 7-day basis (+32.95%), keeping a layer of caution. Lower 10Y yields today (-1.05% to 4.06%) and softer oil (-2.10%) support a risk-on tilt, but the firmer US Dollar over the week (+0.71%) and AI valuation concerns cited in global wrap-ups underscore that the backdrop is still mixed.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** US September jobs report (long-delayed): labor strength or weakness could swing risk sentiment; a softer print would likely support risk assets via yields, while a hot print could revive rate concerns.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — A tech-led rebound (S&P 500 +1.33%, Nasdaq +1.43%, Russell 2000 +3.12%) alongside lower VIX (-11.88% to 23.28), supportive futures (ES/NQ/YM ~+1.41%, RTY +3.13%), and a 10Y yield dip (-1.05% to 4.06%) favors further upside, though elevated weekly vol and the pending jobs report cap confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch equity and vol pivots: S&P futures near 6,649 and Russell futures at 2,383 for follow-through; sustained strength in semis and broader tech tied to Nvidia’s print should support the bias. A VIX hold near or below the current 23.28 and below yesterday’s reference 26.42 would validate risk-on into the next session. Track macro gauges that align with the move: 10Y Treasury yield around 4.06 (a hold below yesterday’s 4.106 reference supports equities), the US Dollar at 100.18 (further dollar strength could dampen risk), and WTI crude at 57.90 (continued softness may ease inflation pressure). The September jobs report is the primary data swing factor; a benign outcome would likely keep the rebound intact, while a hot surprise could challenge it.
