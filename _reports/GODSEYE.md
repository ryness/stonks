  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across assets, the tone is risk-on with broad equity gains and subdued volatility. Major US indices are all higher on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.65%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.81%, Dow up 0.48%, and small-cap Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the average index change is a solid 0.73%. Over the past week and month, returns remain positive across the board, with the Russell leading at +4.94% (7d) and +6.42% (30d), pointing to improving risk appetite rather than defensive positioning.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm this constructive tone. The VIX is down 6.21% on the day and roughly 22% over 30 days to 14.49, signaling a continued compression in equity risk premia even as it is marginally higher on the week (+1.12%). S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all higher between 0.47% and 0.98% on the day and 0.87% to 4.73% on the week, indicating that overnight and forward-looking positioning remains skewed toward higher equity prices.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are moderately mixed but not undermining the risk-on tone. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat to slightly lower on the day (-0.29%) but up 0.99% over the week and 4.22% over 30 days to 4.17%, suggesting some ongoing repricing toward higher-for-longer yields that equities are currently absorbing. Concurrent strength in gold (+0.91% 1d, +8.48% 30d) and crude (+2.35% 1d) alongside a modestly firmer dollar (+0.20% 1d) points to persistent macro and geopolitical hedging, but the dominant message from equities, futures, and volatility is that risk appetite is still improving overall.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears strong based on the benchmark moves. Breadth is robust, with 13 assets up versus only 2 down and none flat, and the average index gain of about 0.73% on the day indicates broad participation rather than a narrow rally. Volatility is contained, with the VIX down more than 6% today and almost 22% over 30 days, suggesting investors are comfortable adding risk. While the 10-year yield has climbed 4.22% over the past month to 4.17%, today's small yield decline and continued equity strength imply that higher rates have not yet derailed the current advance.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and small caps, with the QQQ ETF up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, alongside Nasdaq futures up 0.98%. On a weekly basis, the Russell complex is the clear standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.73%, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.02% and Nasdaq's 1.08% weekly gains. On the downside, the only notable laggard in the risk set is the Dow on a 1-day view at +0.48%, and within macro proxies the VIX is the weakest at -6.21% on the day, reflecting heavy selling of protection rather than equity-specific weakness.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro themes center on mixed US data, firm growth, and evolving Fed expectations. Recent coverage notes that US payrolls have helped cement the view that the Federal Reserve will not cut rates imminently, even as US GDP grew 4.3% in the latest reported quarter, the fastest in two years. This combination of resilient growth and delayed cuts typically supports a moderate risk-on tone in equities while keeping a floor under Treasury yields, which is consistent with the 10-year's 4.22% rise over 30 days and ongoing equity gains. Geopolitics—particularly around Venezuela and tariffs—is another key driver of tape. News highlights the US military capture of Venezuela's President Maduro and the strategic positioning of Chevron in the country's oil sector, alongside commentary that Wall Street is watching Venezuelan conflict dynamics and potential Western Hemisphere energy independence; this has coincided with WTI crude rising 2.35% on the day and 2.02% over the week, generally a modest risk-on for energy and defense while adding a geopolitical-risk premium. At the same time, markets are focused on a coming US Supreme Court ruling on Trump-era tariffs; coverage suggests a ruling against broad tariff powers could boost risk assets by reducing trade uncertainty, whereas an affirmation would be more risk-off, so current equity strength likely reflects cautious optimism priced into that binary event. Global equity sentiment is being tempered by softer Asia and shifting rate-cut odds. Reports indicate Asian stocks have fallen as earlier optimism fades, even as US bonds hold recent gains and traders reassess how mixed US data will shape Fed rate cuts, which dovetails with the modest weekly rise in the US 10-year yield and a slightly stronger dollar on the week (+0.91%). This keeps some pressure on global risk markets but has not yet derailed US risk-on behavior, leading to a tape where US indices continue to grind higher while investors still maintain hedges via gold, which is up 2.75% over the week and 8.48% over the month.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key triggers over the next 24 hours include the US Supreme Court's hearing and potential ruling on Trump's tariff powers, which could materially swing equities and bonds depending on whether trade uncertainty is reduced (likely risk-on) or prolonged (more risk-off). Asia-Pacific trading and China's imminent inflation data, highlighted as a focus for regional markets, could influence global risk sentiment and overnight S&P 500 futures. Additionally, ongoing headlines around Venezuela's political situation and energy supply, as well as any incremental commentary on Fed rate expectations following recent payrolls data, could drive moves in crude, yields, and broader risk assets.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The bias for the next 24 hours is modestly up, as all major US indices and futures are currently higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%; S&P futures +0.62%, Nasdaq futures +0.98%), breadth is strong, and the VIX is down over 6% to 14.49. While the 10-year yield is elevated versus a month ago, it is slightly lower today, and recent macro news points to solid US growth with no immediate shock to risk sentiment. The main risk to this view is event-driven—especially the forthcoming Supreme Court tariff case and geopolitical developments around Venezuela—but current pricing suggests the market is leaning to a positive outcome rather than de-risking.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should monitor key equity benchmarks and their corresponding futures for confirmation of the current uptrend. On the S&P 500, the area around the recent close near 6,966 and S&P futures around 7,005 serve as important reference zones; holding above these levels alongside a firm Nasdaq futures tape near 25,938 would be consistent with the projected upside bias. Particular attention should be paid to leadership from QQQ and the Russell complex, which are outperforming on both 1-day and 7-day horizons, as sustained strength there would reinforce a pro-growth, small-cap-led risk-on environment. On the macro side, keep a close eye on the 10-year Treasury yield around 4.17% and the VIX near 14.5. Stability or further softening in yields and a VIX that stays compressed or drifts lower would support continued multiple expansion and risk-taking; a sharp backup in yields or a VIX reversal higher from these levels would be an early warning that the short-term upside bias is under threat. In parallel, watch WTI crude around $59 and gold near $4,490 as barometers of geopolitical tension and hedging demand; a spike in either, especially linked to new Venezuela or tariff headlines, could quickly alter the equity risk-reward into the next session. Event-wise, traders should closely track developments from the US Supreme Court's tariff case and any new communication around US trade or energy policy, as these have been explicitly flagged in recent coverage as potential market movers. Overnight Asia-Pacific trading and China's inflation print will also be important for gauging whether the recent weakness in Asian stocks persists or reverses, which could feed back into early-session moves in US futures. Aligning intraday positioning with how equities, rates, and volatility react to these discrete catalysts will be key to navigating the expected modestly upward bias.

## 1. Pulse

Across assets, the tone is risk-on with broad equity gains and subdued volatility. Major US indices are all higher on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.65%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.81%, Dow up 0.48%, and small-cap Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the average index change is a solid 0.73%. Over the past week and month, returns remain positive across the board, with the Russell leading at +4.94% (7d) and +6.42% (30d), pointing to improving risk appetite rather than defensive positioning.

Volatility and futures confirm this constructive tone. The VIX is down 6.21% on the day and roughly 22% over 30 days to 14.49, signaling a continued compression in equity risk premia even as it is marginally higher on the week (+1.12%). S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all higher between 0.47% and 0.98% on the day and 0.87% to 4.73% on the week, indicating that overnight and forward-looking positioning remains skewed toward higher equity prices.

Rates and cross-asset signals are moderately mixed but not undermining the risk-on tone. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat to slightly lower on the day (-0.29%) but up 0.99% over the week and 4.22% over 30 days to 4.17%, suggesting some ongoing repricing toward higher-for-longer yields that equities are currently absorbing. Concurrent strength in gold (+0.91% 1d, +8.48% 30d) and crude (+2.35% 1d) alongside a modestly firmer dollar (+0.20% 1d) points to persistent macro and geopolitical hedging, but the dominant message from equities, futures, and volatility is that risk appetite is still improving overall.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears strong based on the benchmark moves. Breadth is robust, with 13 assets up versus only 2 down and none flat, and the average index gain of about 0.73% on the day indicates broad participation rather than a narrow rally. Volatility is contained, with the VIX down more than 6% today and almost 22% over 30 days, suggesting investors are comfortable adding risk. While the 10-year yield has climbed 4.22% over the past month to 4.17%, today's small yield decline and continued equity strength imply that higher rates have not yet derailed the current advance.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and small caps, with the QQQ ETF up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, alongside Nasdaq futures up 0.98%. On a weekly basis, the Russell complex is the clear standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.73%, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.02% and Nasdaq's 1.08% weekly gains. On the downside, the only notable laggard in the risk set is the Dow on a 1-day view at +0.48%, and within macro proxies the VIX is the weakest at -6.21% on the day, reflecting heavy selling of protection rather than equity-specific weakness.

This combination of resilient growth and delayed cuts typically supports a moderate risk-on tone in equities while keeping a floor under Treasury yields, which is consistent with the 10-year's 4.22% rise over 30 days and ongoing equity gains.

Asia-Pacific trading and China's imminent inflation data, highlighted as a focus for regional markets, could influence global risk sentiment and overnight S&P 500 futures. Additionally, ongoing headlines around Venezuela's political situation and energy supply, as well as any incremental commentary on Fed rate expectations following recent payrolls data, could drive moves in crude, yields, and broader risk assets.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The bias for the next 24 hours is modestly up, as all major US indices and futures are currently higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%; S&P futures +0.62%, Nasdaq futures +0.98%), breadth is strong, and the VIX is down over 6% to 14.49. While the 10-year yield is elevated versus a month ago, it is slightly lower today, and recent macro news points to solid US growth with no immediate shock to risk sentiment. The main risk to this view is event-driven—especially the forthcoming Supreme Court tariff case and geopolitical developments around Venezuela—but current pricing suggests the market is leaning to a positive outcome rather than de-risking.

3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should monitor key equity benchmarks and their corresponding futures for confirmation of the current uptrend. On the S&P 500, the area around the recent close near 6,966 and S&P futures around 7,005 serve as important reference zones; holding above these levels alongside a firm Nasdaq futures tape near 25,938 would be consistent with the projected upside bias. Particular attention should be paid to leadership from QQQ and the Russell complex, which are outperforming on both 1-day and 7-day horizons, as sustained strength there would reinforce a pro-growth, small-cap-led risk-on environment. On the macro side, keep a close eye on the 10-year Treasury yield around 4.17% and the VIX near 14.5. Stability or further softening in yields and a VIX that stays compressed or drifts lower would support continued multiple expansion and risk-taking; a sharp backup in yields or a VIX reversal higher from these levels would be an early warning that the short-term upside bias is under threat. In parallel, watch WTI crude around $59 and gold near $4,490 as barometers of geopolitical tension and hedging demand; a spike in either, especially linked to new Venezuela or tariff headlines, could quickly alter the equity risk-reward into the next session. Event-wise, traders should closely track developments from the US Supreme Court's tariff case and any new communication around US trade or energy policy, as these have been explicitly flagged in recent coverage as potential market movers. Overnight Asia-Pacific trading and China's inflation print will also be important for gauging whether the recent weakness in Asian stocks persists or reverses, which could feed back into early-session moves in US futures. Aligning intraday positioning with how equities, rates, and volatility react to these discrete catalysts will be key to navigating the expected modestly upward bias.
