  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities finished mixed with a slight negative tilt as the average index change was -0.05% and breadth was 7 up vs 8 down; the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65% while the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 eked out gains of 0.13% and 0.22%, respectively. This points to a tentative, sector-skewed bid rather than broad-based risk-taking.
  
  Volatility eased on the day but remains elevated: VIX fell 0.85% to 19.83, yet it is up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over 30 days, signaling lingering risk aversion. Futures echoed the cash tone with ES -0.07%, NQ flat, YM -0.67%, and RTY +0.25% on the day, while the week-over-week trend is softer across majors (ES -1.03%, NQ -2.53%, RTY -3.13%).
  
  Rates firmed, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15% (roughly flat week over week at -0.22%), which is a mild headwind to equities. Overall, risk appetite is fading on a weekly horizon but stabilized intraday, with growth and small caps showing relative resilience against a softer Dow.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously weak: breadth was slightly negative at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners and the average index move was -0.05%, suggesting a marginal risk-off skew. Volatility is still elevated with VIX at 19.83, down 0.85% on the day but up 10.11% week over week, indicating underlying fragility. The 10Y yield edged up to 4.15% (+0.88% 1d), a modest drag on equity multiples. Together, the mix points to a market that is stabilizing but not firmly healthy.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership was mixed on the day, with the Russell 2000 (+0.22% 1d) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.13% 1d) outperforming, while the Dow 30 (-0.65% 1d) lagged. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed (Russell 2000 -3.11% 7d, Nasdaq Composite -2.55% 7d), whereas the Dow held up best on a relative basis (-0.35% 7d).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment has been pressured by a tech-led sell-off and concerns over the Chinese economy, as highlighted by reports that global markets struggled following Wall Street’s worst day in a month. This aligns with the week’s drawdowns in growth-linked benchmarks (Nasdaq Composite -2.55% 7d, NQ futures -2.53% 7d), reinforcing a risk-off bias on a multi-day view. Trade headlines were incrementally supportive with Australia welcoming the removal of tariffs on beef and other food imports, a modest risk-on signal for commodities and related equities. The tone is consistent with firmer cyclicals like WTI crude (+2.39% 1d), suggesting selective appetite for reflation-linked assets despite broader equity caution. Geopolitical tension persists, including reports on constrained Gaza aid, which can sustain a higher volatility premium. This backdrop helps explain why VIX remains elevated on a weekly basis (+10.11% 7d) even as it eased slightly today.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55%: Index moves were marginal (average -0.05% with near-even breadth 7/8), VIX eased on the day but remains elevated on the week, and futures were little changed (ES -0.07%, NQ flat) while 10Y yields ticked up to 4.15%. Mixed leadership (Dow weak, growth and small caps firmer) and lack of clear near-term catalysts argue for range-bound trade over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P 500 futures around 6,755 and Nasdaq futures near 25,094 for confirmation of range boundaries, alongside VIX near the 20 handle which has capped risk appetite; a sustained move below 20 would support stabilization. Keep an eye on the 10Y yield at 4.15%; further backing up in yields would likely pressure the Dow and defensives while a pullback could aid a modest bounce. Monitor factor rotation and breadth: does small-cap strength persist with Russell futures holding above 2,396 and cash RUT near 2,388, and can QQQ around 608.86 firm up? If small caps fail to build on today’s +0.25% and tech cannot stabilize after a weak week, the tape likely stays contained. Commodity and FX gauges can color risk tone: WTI around 60.09 is a key pivot for cyclicals, Gold at 4,087.60 reflects haven demand ebbing today, and the US Dollar at 99.27 softening on the week (-0.93% 7d) is a marginal tailwind for risk. Stability in these levels would complement a flat, range-bound equity session.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-15T13:44:49.153328+00:00">2025-11-15 13:44 UTC</time> (runtime 44.41s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities finished mixed with a slight negative tilt as the average index change was -0.05% and breadth was 7 up vs 8 down; the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65% while the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 eked out gains of 0.13% and 0.22%, respectively. This points to a tentative, sector-skewed bid rather than broad-based risk-taking.

Volatility eased on the day but remains elevated: VIX fell 0.85% to 19.83, yet it is up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over 30 days, signaling lingering risk aversion. Futures echoed the cash tone with ES -0.07%, NQ flat, YM -0.67%, and RTY +0.25% on the day, while the week-over-week trend is softer across majors (ES -1.03%, NQ -2.53%, RTY -3.13%).

Rates firmed, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15% (roughly flat week over week at -0.22%), which is a mild headwind to equities. Overall, risk appetite is fading on a weekly horizon but stabilized intraday, with growth and small caps showing relative resilience against a softer Dow.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously weak: breadth was slightly negative at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners and the average index move was -0.05%, suggesting a marginal risk-off skew. Volatility is still elevated with VIX at 19.83, down 0.85% on the day but up 10.11% week over week, indicating underlying fragility. The 10Y yield edged up to 4.15% (+0.88% 1d), a modest drag on equity multiples. Together, the mix points to a market that is stabilizing but not firmly healthy.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership was mixed on the day, with the Russell 2000 (+0.22% 1d) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.13% 1d) outperforming, while the Dow 30 (-0.65% 1d) lagged. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed (Russell 2000 -3.11% 7d, Nasdaq Composite -2.55% 7d), whereas the Dow held up best on a relative basis (-0.35% 7d).

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment has been pressured by a tech-led sell-off and concerns over the Chinese economy, as highlighted by reports that global markets struggled following Wall Street’s worst day in a month. This aligns with the week’s drawdowns in growth-linked benchmarks (Nasdaq Composite -2.55% 7d, NQ futures -2.53% 7d), reinforcing a risk-off bias on a multi-day view. Trade headlines were incrementally supportive with Australia welcoming the removal of tariffs on beef and other food imports, a modest risk-on signal for commodities and related equities. The tone is consistent with firmer cyclicals like WTI crude (+2.39% 1d), suggesting selective appetite for reflation-linked assets despite broader equity caution. Geopolitical tension persists, including reports on constrained Gaza aid, which can sustain a higher volatility premium. This backdrop helps explain why VIX remains elevated on a weekly basis (+10.11% 7d) even as it eased slightly today.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55%: Index moves were marginal (average -0.05% with near-even breadth 7/8), VIX eased on the day but remains elevated on the week, and futures were little changed (ES -0.07%, NQ flat) while 10Y yields ticked up to 4.15%. Mixed leadership (Dow weak, growth and small caps firmer) and lack of clear near-term catalysts argue for range-bound trade over the next 24 hours.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P 500 futures around 6,755 and Nasdaq futures near 25,094 for confirmation of range boundaries, alongside VIX near the 20 handle which has capped risk appetite; a sustained move below 20 would support stabilization. Keep an eye on the 10Y yield at 4.15%; further backing up in yields would likely pressure the Dow and defensives while a pullback could aid a modest bounce. Monitor factor rotation and breadth: does small-cap strength persist with Russell futures holding above 2,396 and cash RUT near 2,388, and can QQQ around 608.86 firm up? If small caps fail to build on today’s +0.25% and tech cannot stabilize after a weak week, the tape likely stays contained. Commodity and FX gauges can color risk tone: WTI around 60.09 is a key pivot for cyclicals, Gold at 4,087.60 reflects haven demand ebbing today, and the US Dollar at 99.27 softening on the week (-0.93% 7d) is a marginal tailwind for risk. Stability in these levels would complement a flat, range-bound equity session.
