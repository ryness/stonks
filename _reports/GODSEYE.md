  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite faded today across equities, with the S&P 500 down 0.51%, Nasdaq Composite off 1.02%, Russell 2000 lower by 0.94%, and the Dow 30 relatively resilient at -0.12%. Breadth was weak (4 up vs 11 down) and the average index change was -0.66%, signaling a broad risk-off tilt rather than a narrow pullback.
  
  Volatility firmed as the VIX rose 3.71% to 18.16, even though it remains 4.42% lower over the past week; on a 30-day view it is still up 9.20%, indicating elevated background risk. Rates also leaned risk-off, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 1.16% to 4.11, a backdrop that coincided with growth and tech underperformance.
  
  Futures pointed softer: S&P -0.42%, Nasdaq -0.58%, Russell -0.86%, and Dow -0.17% on the day. On a weekly basis the tone is mixed-to-constructive with Dow futures up 2.27% and S&P futures up 0.66%, but Nasdaq futures down 0.39%, reflecting a rotation toward the Dow’s leadership while growth remains more tentative.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is soft today. Breadth skewed negative (4 advancers vs 11 decliners) and the average index change was -0.66%, pointing to broad selling. The VIX advanced 3.71% to 18.16 while the 10Y yield rose 1.16% to 4.11, a combo consistent with de-risking. Despite some weekly improvements, today’s setup is below average in robustness.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to the Dow 30, which was the relative winner at -0.12% 1d, while the Nasdaq Composite lagged at -1.02% 1d. Over the week, the Dow 30 leads (+2.36% 7d) and the Nasdaq Composite trails (-0.77% 7d), with the Russell 2000 essentially flat (+0.02% 7d).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** U.S. political risk remained front and center as investors awaited a key House vote that could end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, a catalyst flagged in multiple reports. The uncertainty skewed risk-off today, aligning with a higher VIX (+3.71% 1d) and heavier Nasdaq performance; passage would be risk-on, while delays or failure would likely pressure sentiment. AI-related headlines contributed to tech volatility. AMD shares surged 7% after outlining aggressive AI-driven growth targets, yet broader Big Tech ‘wobbled’ into the session, which maps to the Nasdaq Composite falling 1.02% and QQQ down 0.84% on the day; this mix of single-name strength and index-level softness kept risk appetite uneven. Cross-asset tone showed pockets of caution: crypto headlines cited ‘macro jitters’ alongside ETF outflows, while gold has surged on a 7-day and 30-day basis (+6.55% and +9.55%, respectively). These signals dovetail with today’s higher equity volatility and suggest a still-sensitive macro tape.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. House vote on ending the government shutdown: a pass would likely be risk-on (supporting equities and capping volatility), while delays or failure would be risk-off. Other major scheduled catalysts are unknown based on the provided information.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Given today’s broad but moderate declines (average index change -0.66%), higher VIX (+3.71%), and firmer 10Y yields (+1.16%) offset by still-positive weekly momentum in the Dow and S&P futures, the balance of catalysts and positioning points to a sideways bias pending the outcome of the House shutdown vote.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index and futures pivots: ES=F around 6,846.75 versus its 7-day reference near 6,801.75, NQ=F at 25,475.25, and RTY=F at 2,438.80 given small-cap underperformance (-0.86% 1d). On cash markets, S&P 500 at 6,815.71 and Nasdaq Composite at 23,168.82 are the key risk gauges into the next session. Monitor volatility and rates: VIX at 18.16 with the 7-day reference at 19.00—reclaiming 19 would likely pressure equities, while a drift lower would ease conditions. The 10Y Treasury at 4.11 is a headwind for growth; further upside would keep pressure on the Nasdaq and QQQ (-0.84% 1d). Track leadership dispersion: the Dow 30’s relative strength (1d -0.12%, 7d +2.36%) versus the Nasdaq’s weakness (1d -1.02%, 7d -0.77%) is central to the tape. Tech/AI headlines (e.g., post-AMD enthusiasm) should be weighed against index-level softness; sustained lag in NQ=F relative to YM=F would corroborate a continued rotation.
