  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a cautious bid with breadth positive (11 up, 3 down, 1 flat) and an average index gain of 0.07%. The S&P 500 and Dow inched higher (+0.13% and +0.16%), small caps led (+0.58%), while the Nasdaq slipped (-0.21%). Risk appetite improved modestly on the day but remains softer over the week, with the S&P 500 -2.35% and Nasdaq -3.98% over 7 days.
  
  Volatility eased intraday as the VIX fell 2.15% to 19.08, but it is still elevated versus recent history, up 12.77% week-over-week and 24.79% month-over-month. Rates were steady with the 10Y Treasury unchanged on the day at 4.09% (up ~0.86% w/w, down ~2.25% m/m), reflecting a stable but cautious macro backdrop.
  
  Futures point to stabilization: S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts are up 0.17%–0.85% over the last day, with Nasdaq futures leading (+0.85%). However, all major equity futures remain lower over the past week (-0.88% to -1.94%), underscoring that risk appetite has only tentatively improved overnight within a still corrective weekly trend.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive but fragile. Breadth favored gains (11 up vs. 3 down and 1 flat) and the average index move was a modest +0.07%, signaling only a shallow rebound. Volatility eased on the day (VIX -2.15% to 19.08) but remains elevated on a 7–30 day basis, and the 10Y Treasury held steady at 4.09%, indicating no fresh relief from rates. Together, this points to a market attempting to stabilize after a weak week, with risk appetite improving only at the margin.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward small caps, with the Russell 2000 up +0.58% on the day, while large-cap tech lagged as the Nasdaq fell -0.21% (QQQ -0.32%). Over the last week, the Nasdaq is the clear laggard (-3.98%), while the Dow held up best among major indices (-1.35%). A positive standout today is the Russell 2000 (+0.58%), and a negative standout is the Nasdaq Composite (-0.21%).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A tech-led pullback tied to valuation concerns remains the central macro theme. Multiple reports highlight the worst tech sell-off since April and a global chip retreat on valuation fears, which pressured the Nasdaq and semiconductors and fostered a risk-off tone (Yahoo Finance; The Times of India; Fortune). This dynamic has tilted leadership away from mega-cap tech and increased index-level volatility. Investors are also watching U.S. economic signals amid worries about a cooling labor market and uncertainty around a prolonged government shutdown (The Times of India). Headlines about deteriorating jobs data have reinforced caution, supporting a defensive tilt and elevating volatility, which is consistent with a higher VIX on a weekly basis. Broader sentiment has been influenced by high-profile corporate headlines, including Musk’s $1T pay package and layoff news flow, which contributed to choppy trading (Yahoo Finance). Global spillovers were evident as Asian shares sank following Big Tech weakness, extending the risk-off impulse across regions (BusinessLine; ABC News).
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. confidence data and scheduled Fed speak are on tap (Barchart). These could sway rates and the equity tone: softer confidence would likely support a relief bid by containing yields, while firmer readings could revive valuation and rate worries, particularly for tech.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%—Futures are green (ES +0.53%, NQ +0.85%, RTY +0.54%), breadth was positive, and the VIX eased on the day, while rates are steady at 4.09%; the main risk to this view is ongoing tech underperformance and an elevated VIX on a weekly basis.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures for follow-through: S&P 500 futures near 6,789 and Nasdaq futures around 25,381 need to hold gains; a fade back toward their 1-day references (ES 6,753.75 and NQ 25,166.25) would undercut the intraday ‘up’ bias. In cash, observe whether the S&P 500 (~6,728.80) can build on small gains while the Nasdaq stops lagging. Monitor leadership and macro gauges: can the Russell 2000 (+0.58% on the day) continue to outperform while the Nasdaq (-0.21%) stabilizes? Keep an eye on the VIX near 19—further downside would validate a risk-on tone—and the 10Y Treasury at 4.09% for any move that pressures equity multiples. Also track Gold’s strength (+1.38% 1d) and WTI’s downtrend over 30 days (-5.17%) as cross-asset reads on risk appetite and growth expectations.
