  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a mixed tone with the S&P 500 down 0.05% and the Dow off 0.65%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.22%. Breadth leaned positive (11 up, 4 down) but the average index change was slightly negative at -0.05%, and volatility remains elevated with the VIX at 19.97, up 0.71% on the day and 21.99% over 30 days, indicating risk appetite has faded over the past week.
  
  Futures point to a tentative rebound into the next session: S&P +0.45%, Nasdaq +0.74%, Dow +0.10%, and Russell +0.25%. Rates and FX are a headwind, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15 and the US Dollar up 0.12%, while gold’s 7-day rise (+2.75%) signals lingering defensiveness. Net-net, near-term risk appetite is cautiously improving in futures, but the weekly drawdowns across the S&P (-0.91%), Nasdaq (-2.55%), and Russell (-3.11%) keep overall tone fragile.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mixed-to-fragile. Breadth was constructive (11 up vs 4 down), yet the average index change was slightly negative at -0.05%, reflecting narrow leadership and muted conviction. Elevated volatility (VIX 19.97, +0.71% 1d and +21.99% 30d) and a 10Y yield at 4.15 (+0.88% 1d) temper the picture. On balance, the setup suggests a cautious market with improving futures but still-sensitive risk conditions.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, small caps and tech led, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 is the notable laggard at -3.11% and the Nasdaq Composite fell -2.55%, whereas the Dow 30 held up best at -0.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI leadership and positioning are in focus, with investors awaiting Nvidia’s report next week and reassessing stretched valuations, per the news flow. This backdrop contributed to mixed tape action where the Nasdaq held a modest gain (+0.13%) and QQQ edged higher (+0.08%), but the broader market remained cautious, consistent with a risk-on bias in select tech pockets and a risk-off skew in the broader weekly performance. Rate-cut doubts and data uncertainty are weighing on sentiment, as reports highlight a ‘data fog’ after the US government shutdown and hawkish Fed commentary dampening near-term cut hopes. That aligns with higher volatility (VIX +2.41% 7d) and the 10Y yield ticking up on the day (+0.88% to 4.15), while weekly equity declines (S&P -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, Russell -3.11%) reflect a broader risk-off impulse.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 58%—Futures are bid (ES +0.45%, NQ +0.74%, RTY +0.25%) and breadth was positive, suggesting a modest rebound, though elevated VIX (19.97) and a 10Y yield uptick to 4.15 cap confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P futures can hold gains near 6,785.75 and if Nasdaq futures sustain momentum above 25,280.5; continued tech resilience would support an up-bias. A VIX hold near or below 20.00 (last 19.97) would help risk, while a push higher would threaten the bounce. Track small caps for confirmation: Russell futures at 2,401.90 need follow-through toward last week’s reference area near 2,427 to signal improving breadth. Also monitor the 10Y yield around 4.15 and the US Dollar at 99.39; further day-on-day strength in either could restrain cyclicals and the magnitude of any equity rebound.
