  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities finished mixed with a slight negative skew, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65% while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.22%; breadth was nearly balanced (7 up, 8 down) and the average index change was essentially flat at -0.05%. Futures told a similar story with S&P futures -0.07%, Dow futures -0.67%, Nasdaq futures roughly unchanged, and Russell futures +0.25%, indicating a tentative risk appetite concentrated away from the Dow but not broad-based.
  
  Volatility eased on the day with VIX -0.85% to 19.83, but it remains elevated versus the week (+10.11%) and month (+19.10%), signaling lingering risk aversion despite the daily calm. Rates were a headwind, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15% (slightly below a week ago), which can pressure equity multiples and temper risk-taking.
  
  Macro proxies were mixed: WTI crude rose 2.39% to 60.09, favoring cyclicals, while gold fell 2.37% on the day despite being up 2.70% over the week, and the US Dollar edged up 0.09%. Net-net, risk appetite is cautious-to-mixed—improving intraday via lower VIX and small gains in growth/small caps, but fading on a weekly basis given broad equity declines (S&P 7d -1.03% via futures; Nasdaq 7d -2.53%; Russell 7d -3.13%) and a higher volatility regime.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral to soft. Breadth was nearly even at 7 advancers versus 8 decliners and the average index change was a negligible -0.05%, pointing to indecision rather than momentum. VIX sits at 19.83, down 0.85% on the day but up 10.11% over the week, and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%, a combination that keeps risk-taking constrained. Against that backdrop, modest gains in Nasdaq and small caps were not enough to offset the Dow’s 0.65% decline, leaving the tape fragile.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow was the clear laggard at -0.65%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 (-3.11%) and Nasdaq (-2.55%) have underperformed, whereas the Dow (-0.35%) has been comparatively resilient. Today’s positive standout: Russell 2000 +0.22%; negative standout: Dow 30 -0.65%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment remains sensitive to the recent tech sell-off and concerns about the Chinese economy, as highlighted by reports that global markets struggled following Wall Street’s worst day in a month and a slump in investment in China. This backdrop aligns with the past week’s weakness in Nasdaq futures (-2.53%) and the Russell (-3.13%), reinforcing a risk-off tilt on a weekly horizon despite today’s modest stabilization. Domestic narratives of tech overvaluation and economic uncertainty have also weighed on US markets, consistent with recent articles describing pressure on Wall Street. That caution shows up in the volatility profile, with VIX up 10.11% over the week to 19.83, and equities broadly lower over seven days (S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%), supporting a defensive tone. Policy and geopolitics add cross-currents: Australia’s welcome of US tariff removal on beef and other food imports is modestly risk-on for trade exposure, while reports on Gaza planning underscore ongoing geopolitical risk that can cap risk appetite. The net effect is a mixed catalyst set that aligns with day-to-day stabilization (VIX -0.85% today) but restrained positioning over the week.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed signals dominate: breadth was 7 up vs 8 down with an average index change of -0.05%, VIX eased 0.85% today but remains elevated on the week (+10.11% to 19.83), and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15% while S&P futures were -0.07% and Nasdaq futures were roughly unchanged. News flow points to tech and China-related caution offset by minor trade-policy positives, favoring rangebound trade over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures around current marks for signs of follow-through or fade: ES=F near 6,755, NQ=F around 25,094, YM=F at 47,229, and RTY=F near 2,396. A steady tape around these levels would align with a flat bias, while a decisive move in YM=F relative to RTY=F could signal rotation between blue chips and small caps. Monitor volatility and rates for confirmation: VIX holding near 19.8–20.0 versus its recent weekly rise will inform risk appetite, and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.15% is a key headwind if it climbs further. A drift lower in VIX alongside a stable 10Y would support a muted, rangebound session; a VIX push higher or yields backing up further would argue for downside pressure. Track sector proxies via commodities and FX: WTI crude at 60.09 supports energy, while gold at 4,087.6 and the US Dollar at 99.27 frame the safety bid and financial conditions. If energy strength persists while tech remains soft (echoing the week’s -2.53% move in Nasdaq futures), the index mix could stay choppy without a clear index leader.

## 1. Pulse

Equities finished mixed with a slight negative skew, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65% while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.22%; breadth was nearly balanced (7 up, 8 down) and the average index change was essentially flat at -0.05%. Futures told a similar story with S&P futures -0.07%, Dow futures -0.67%, Nasdaq futures roughly unchanged, and Russell futures +0.25%, indicating a tentative risk appetite concentrated away from the Dow but not broad-based.

Volatility eased on the day with VIX -0.85% to 19.83, but it remains elevated versus the week (+10.11%) and month (+19.10%), signaling lingering risk aversion despite the daily calm. Rates were a headwind, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15% (slightly below a week ago), which can pressure equity multiples and temper risk-taking.

Macro proxies were mixed: WTI crude rose 2.39% to 60.09, favoring cyclicals, while gold fell 2.37% on the day despite being up 2.70% over the week, and the US Dollar edged up 0.09%. Net-net, risk appetite is cautious-to-mixed—improving intraday via lower VIX and small gains in growth/small caps, but fading on a weekly basis given broad equity declines (S&P 7d -1.03% via futures; Nasdaq 7d -2.53%; Russell 7d -3.13%) and a higher volatility regime.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral to soft. Breadth was nearly even at 7 advancers versus 8 decliners and the average index change was a negligible -0.05%, pointing to indecision rather than momentum. VIX sits at 19.83, down 0.85% on the day but up 10.11% over the week, and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%, a combination that keeps risk-taking constrained. Against that backdrop, modest gains in Nasdaq and small caps were not enough to offset the Dow’s 0.65% decline, leaving the tape fragile.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow was the clear laggard at -0.65%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 (-3.11%) and Nasdaq (-2.55%) have underperformed, whereas the Dow (-0.35%) has been comparatively resilient. Today’s positive standout: Russell 2000 +0.22%; negative standout: Dow 30 -0.65%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment remains sensitive to the recent tech sell-off and concerns about the Chinese economy, as highlighted by reports that global markets struggled following Wall Street’s worst day in a month and a slump in investment in China. This backdrop aligns with the past week’s weakness in Nasdaq futures (-2.53%) and the Russell (-3.13%), reinforcing a risk-off tilt on a weekly horizon despite today’s modest stabilization. Domestic narratives of tech overvaluation and economic uncertainty have also weighed on US markets, consistent with recent articles describing pressure on Wall Street. That caution shows up in the volatility profile, with VIX up 10.11% over the week to 19.83, and equities broadly lower over seven days (S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%), supporting a defensive tone. Policy and geopolitics add cross-currents: Australia’s welcome of US tariff removal on beef and other food imports is modestly risk-on for trade exposure, while reports on Gaza planning underscore ongoing geopolitical risk that can cap risk appetite. The net effect is a mixed catalyst set that aligns with day-to-day stabilization (VIX -0.85% today) but restrained positioning over the week.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed signals dominate: breadth was 7 up vs 8 down with an average index change of -0.05%, VIX eased 0.85% today but remains elevated on the week (+10.11% to 19.83), and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15% while S&P futures were -0.07% and Nasdaq futures were roughly unchanged. News flow points to tech and China-related caution offset by minor trade-policy positives, favoring rangebound trade over the next 24 hours.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures around current marks for signs of follow-through or fade: ES=F near 6,755, NQ=F around 25,094, YM=F at 47,229, and RTY=F near 2,396. A steady tape around these levels would align with a flat bias, while a decisive move in YM=F relative to RTY=F could signal rotation between blue chips and small caps. Monitor volatility and rates for confirmation: VIX holding near 19.8–20.0 versus its recent weekly rise will inform risk appetite, and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.15% is a key headwind if it climbs further. A drift lower in VIX alongside a stable 10Y would support a muted, rangebound session; a VIX push higher or yields backing up further would argue for downside pressure. Track sector proxies via commodities and FX: WTI crude at 60.09 supports energy, while gold at 4,087.6 and the US Dollar at 99.27 frame the safety bid and financial conditions. If energy strength persists while tech remains soft (echoing the week’s -2.53% move in Nasdaq futures), the index mix could stay choppy without a clear index leader.
