  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Equities are showing a clear risk-on tone in the very short term, with all major U.S. benchmarks higher on the day and an average index gain of about 0.94%. The Nasdaq Composite leads with a +1.31% move, followed by the S&P 500 at +0.88% and the Russell 2000 at +0.86%, while the Dow lags but is still positive at +0.38%. This is reinforced by tech-heavy QQQ up +1.30% and broad SPY up +0.91%, indicating improving risk appetite after a softer week.",
      "Volatility and futures confirm the risk-on bias. The VIX is down sharply, falling 11.62% on the day and over 23% in 30 days to 14.91, signaling investors are more comfortable taking equity risk. Equity futures are extending the move, with S&P futures up +1.57%, Nasdaq futures +2.14%, Dow futures +0.84%, and Russell futures +1.65% over the last day, suggesting follow-through buying interest beyond cash-session gains.",
      "Rates and cross-asset signals are moderately mixed but not threatening risk sentiment. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15%, yet is slightly lower over the past week (-0.31%), implying only a mild backup in yields alongside stronger stocks. Gold is also firm with a +1.68% 1d and +10.88% 30d rise, which, together with a slightly softer dollar over 30 days (-1.02%), points to ongoing demand for hedges but does not outweigh the broad improvement in equity risk appetite."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks constructive, with breadth strongly positive: 13 assets up versus just 2 down and none flat. The average 1-day index gain of roughly 0.94% across the major benchmarks, combined with an 11.62% drop in the VIX to 14.91, suggests a supportive volatility backdrop rather than stress. While the 10Y Treasury yield has ticked up 0.85% on the day to 4.15%, it is slightly lower on the week, indicating rates are not aggressively pressuring valuations. Overall, price action, breadth, and volatility portray a healthy, short-term risk-on environment despite only modest gains over the past week.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in growth and tech, with the Nasdaq Composite up +1.31% and QQQ up +1.30%, while the Russell 2000 also performs well at +0.86%. On the downside, there are no major U.S. equity benchmarks in the red on the day, but recent laggards over the week include QQQ at -1.68% and the Russell 2000 at -1.18%, even after today's bounce. The Dow 30 is the relative 1-day laggard among the big four indexes with a more modest +0.38% move, indicating cyclicals and blue chips are trailing the tech-led rebound.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "The primary macro theme visible in the tape is a tech-led rebound following prior weakness, as highlighted by news noting that "stocks rise with tech boost" and that strength in tech is lifting market sentiment. This aligns with the Nasdaq Composite's +1.31% gain and QQQ's +1.30% 1-day move, as well as Nasdaq futures jumping +2.14%. This tech outperformance is clearly risk-on, pulling broader indices higher and easing concerns around the recent AI- and growth-stock shakeout referenced in global commentary about an AI bubble normalizing.",
      "Central bank policy, particularly in Japan, is another driver of cross-asset positioning. Headlines point to a Bank of Japan rate hike to a three-decade high and note that stocks in Asia rallied with Wall Street even as yen weakened, and that S&P futures are supported as global bond yields climb following this move. This backdrop of still-accommodative global risk appetite despite tightening in Japan is consistent with U.S. equities and crypto showing improved sentiment, and it supports a risk-on bias while nudging bond yields higher.",
      "Seasonal and calendar effects around the extended Christmas holiday are also influencing activity levels. Reporting notes that trading is expected to remain subdued across major global markets due to the Christmas lull, even as some markets contemplate a breakout. This combination of lower expected volumes and a recent positive bias tends to reinforce a gently risk-on but less volatile environment, where directional moves like the current tech-led rally can persist but may be more vulnerable to headline surprises."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the main scheduled catalysts in the data are relatively limited, but several events could still move sentiment. Company-specific earnings such as upcoming reports from FedEx and Darden Restaurants, as highlighted in previews, may influence transport, consumer, and broader cyclical sentiment at the margin. Central-bank-related developments remain important, with markets still digesting the recent Bank of Japan rate hike and broader central bank decision cycle, which can affect global yields, FX, and thus equity futures. With a Christmas lull noted in global markets, any unexpected macro headline or policy comment could have an outsized impact due to thinner liquidity.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The short-term bias leans upward given the alignment of several supportive factors: broad 1-day gains across all major U.S. equity indexes (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%, Dow 30 +0.38%), an even stronger push in equity futures (S&P +1.57%, Nasdaq +2.14%, Russell +1.65%), and a sharply lower VIX (-11.62% to 14.91). The 10Y yield has edged higher but is not significantly tighter on the week, and news flow emphasizes tech-led strength and resilient global risk appetite despite central bank tightening in Japan, all of which tilt the next 24 hours toward a continuation of the current risk-on bounce rather than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Traders should focus on whether the tech-led rebound can sustain, watching Nasdaq futures around 25,669.5 and QQQ near 617 for confirmation of follow-through or signs of exhaustion. The relative performance gap between growth (Nasdaq, QQQ) and value/cyclicals (Dow 30, value-heavy segments) is a key tell; if the Nasdaq continues to outperform, the risk-on tone is likely intact, while a sharp reversal there could quickly drag broader indices lower given how much of the current rally is concentrated in tech.",
      "Overnight, monitoring the behavior of volatility and rates will be crucial. The VIX near 14.9 after a one-day drop of 11.62% is supportive; sustained sub-15 levels would corroborate the "up" bias, while a quick spike back toward the mid- to high-teens would signal renewed risk aversion. Similarly, keep an eye on the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.15% and S&P futures around 6,903.0; if yields grind higher without derailing futures, it suggests equities are comfortable with the rate backdrop, but an equity pullback alongside rising yields would challenge the current bullish stance.",
      "Given the holiday backdrop and relatively light macro calendar, single-name and sector reactions to earnings and headlines could drive marginal flows, especially in transports, consumer, and logistics tied to the FedEx and Darden earnings previews. Traders should also track cross-asset signals from gold, which is elevated at 4,434.6 after a +10.88% 30-day surge, and from the U.S. dollar near 98.58; continued strength in gold alongside a stable or slightly softer dollar would be consistent with moderate risk-on positioning hedged by safety assets rather than outright de-risking."

    "Equities are showing a clear risk-on tone in the very short term, with all major U.S. benchmarks higher on the day and an average index gain of about 0.94%.

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {\n  &quot;1.0&quot;: [\n    &quot;Equities are showing a clear risk-on tone in the very short term, with all major U.S. benchmarks higher on the day and an average index gain of about 0.94%. The Nasdaq Composite leads with a +1.31% move, followed by the S&amp;P 500 at +0.88% and the Russell 2000 at +0.86%, while the Dow lags but is still positive at +0.38%. This is reinforced by tech-heavy QQQ up +1.30% and broad SPY up +0.91%, indicating improving risk appetite after a softer week.&quot;,\n    &quot;Volatility and futures confirm the risk-on bias. The VIX is down sharply, falling 11.62% on the day and over 23% in 30 day
