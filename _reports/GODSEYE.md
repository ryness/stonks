  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a tentative risk-on rebound today: S&P 500 +0.38%, Nasdaq Composite +0.59%, and Dow +0.10%, while small caps lag with Russell 2000 -0.04%. That said, the weekly tape remains risk-off with the S&P 500 -2.78%, Nasdaq -4.09%, and Russell 2000 -4.39%, signaling an improving day-over-day appetite but a still fragile trend.
  
  Volatility eased but remains elevated: VIX fell 4.17% today to 23.66, yet is up 34.43% over 7 days and 45.15% over 30 days, keeping risk premium high. Futures point to a firmer open/next session skew with S&P +1.48%, Nasdaq +2.20%, Dow +0.56%, and Russell +0.87%. Rates edged up as the 10Y Treasury yield rose to 4.13% (+0.24% 1d), and the US Dollar strengthened (+0.62% 1d), tempering the risk tone.
  
  Cross-asset signals are mixed: Gold is bid (+0.89% 1d) while WTI crude fell (-2.12% 1d), and the Dollar advanced (+0.62% 1d). Net-net, risk appetite is improving on the day, but higher volatility versus the week and firmer yields/dollar suggest the rebound is tentative.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive on the day: breadth is positive (12 up, 3 down) and the average index change is +0.34%. The VIX eased 4.17% to 23.66, but remains elevated versus the past week and month, indicating lingering stress. The 10Y Treasury yield ticked up to 4.13% (+0.24% 1d), a modest headwind alongside a firmer dollar. Overall, conditions improved today but remain less than fully healthy given the higher volatility backdrop and recent weekly drawdowns.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is in growth/tech, with Nasdaq futures up +2.20% and QQQ +0.60% 1d, while small caps lag as the Russell 2000 slipped -0.04% 1d. Over the past week, small caps and tech have been the underperformers (Russell 2000 -4.39%, Nasdaq Composite -4.09%), whereas no major US equity benchmark is positive; the US Dollar is a relative winner on the week (+0.55%). Positive standout (1d): Nasdaq futures +2.20%. Negative standout (1d): Russell 2000 -0.04%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric and diminished expectations for near-term rate cuts have weighed on risk assets in recent sessions, as highlighted in coverage noting tougher Fed talk and fading cut odds. This aligns with a firmer US Dollar (+0.62% 1d) and a slight rise in the 10Y yield to 4.13% (+0.24% 1d), a mix that leans risk-off at the margin even as today’s equity bounce develops. Tech/AI valuation concerns have been a key driver of the recent selloff, with reports of a deepening slide in tech stocks. The performance pattern matches the data: the Nasdaq Composite is -4.09% over 7 days and QQQ is -3.75% over 7 days, underscoring how growth leadership has retrenched and amplifying index volatility (VIX +34.43% over 7 days). Regional tailwinds from hopes of an India-US trade deal and buying in IT counters supported Indian equities, according to multiple reports. While this is a localized risk-on impulse, it contrasts with the broader US weekly weakness and speaks to uneven global risk sentiment.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings are a key near-term catalyst cited across market coverage; a strong print could stabilize tech and lift Nasdaq-linked benchmarks, while a miss could extend risk-off. A delayed US jobs report referenced in coverage is another trigger; a stronger-than-expected print could push yields higher and pressure equities, while a softer number could ease rate fears and support risk.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — Equity futures are firmly higher (ES +1.48%, NQ +2.20%, RTY +0.87%), breadth is positive (12 up, 3 down), and the VIX eased 4.17% on the day, pointing to improving risk appetite, though an elevated VIX versus the week and firmer yields/dollar constrain confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch the tech complex into and after the key earnings print: QQQ (last +0.60% 1d) and Nasdaq futures (NQ=F 25,138, +2.20% 1d) are leading; monitor whether NQ=F can hold above the 25,000 area and whether follow-through broadens beyond mega-cap growth. A constructive reaction would support the up-bias; a reversal would challenge it. Monitor S&P 500 futures (ES=F 6,737.75, +1.48% 1d) for retention of gains around the 6,700 zone and the Russell lens for breadth: Russell 2000 cash 2,347.89 (-0.04% 1d) versus RTY=F 2,376.30 (+0.87% 1d). Sustained small-cap participation would improve the quality of the bounce; renewed small-cap underperformance would signal fragility. Keep an eye on macro signposts that can cap risk: VIX at 23.66 (down 4.17% 1d but elevated on a 7d/30d basis), the 10Y yield at 4.13% (+0.24% 1d), and the US Dollar at 100.18 (+0.62% 1d). If yields and the dollar push higher alongside weakness in WTI (59.45, -2.12% 1d), equity upside may be limited despite positive futures.
