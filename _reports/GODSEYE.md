  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Across U.S. equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with selective strength. The S&P 500 and Dow were modestly higher on the day (around +0.05% and +0.10%), while small caps led with the Russell 2000 up 1.18%, and average index performance across the board was +0.23%. However, tech-heavy benchmarks are lagging, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.22% on the day and off 1.56% over the week, keeping overall risk appetite from being outright robust.",
      "Volatility and futures paint a more defensive picture. The VIX is elevated at 21.84 and jumped 6.0% on the day and over 50% in 30 days, signaling persistent demand for protection despite the modest equity gains. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all slightly negative on the most recent session (ranging from about -0.08% to -0.65%), suggesting fading risk appetite into the next trade date even as spot indices closed mixed to higher.",
      "Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed but lean mildly supportive for risk. The 10-year Treasury yield is down 1.17% on the day and 5.12% over the week to 4.06%, consistent with the recent U.S. CPI release that "supported the outlook for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year" and has helped lift Asian equity sentiment. At the same time, safe-haven gold is pulling back 1.53% on the day after a strong 14.62% 30-day run, while crude is higher on the day and up 10.49% over 30 days, indicating some reflationary or growth-linked positioning even as equity volatility stays elevated."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately constructive but not robust. Breadth is slightly positive with 8 assets up and 7 down, and the average 1-day index move of about +0.23% shows a gentle upward bias rather than a strong advance. The drop in the 10-year yield to 4.06% over the past week (-5.12%) provides a supportive backdrop for equities, but the VIX at 21.84 and up more than 50% over 30 days signals ongoing stress and hedging demand. Overall, conditions are better than a risk-off tape, but elevated volatility and recent weekly declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suggest a somewhat fragile equilibrium.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership has rotated toward cyclicals and smaller caps. Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear standout, gaining 1.18%, while the Dow also outperforms with a 0.10% rise and has added 2.99% over 30 days. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is the notable laggard with a 1-day decline of 0.22% and a 7-day drop of 1.56%, and Nasdaq futures are off 0.65% on the latest print, highlighting tech weakness. This pattern shows small caps and value/cyclical exposures leading near term, while growth/tech benchmarks struggle.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "A key macro driver is the recent U.S. inflation data, which has "supported the outlook for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year" and improved sentiment in Asian equities. This backdrop helps explain why U.S. yields have declined (10-year down 5.12% over the week) and why global risk appetite has not fully rolled over despite elevated volatility. The prospect of eventual policy easing is a risk-on catalyst, but the still-high VIX and only modest gains in the S&P 500 suggest investors are balancing rate-cut hopes against ongoing macro uncertainty.",
      "At the same time, global equity sentiment remains fragile after a recent "Friday the 13th" selloff in stocks and gold tied to AI-related fears and broader risk aversion, as highlighted by multiple reports of broad-based declines in Indian equities and sector-wide weakness. That episode, along with commentary that Goldman's Panic Index is nearing "max fear," reflects a risk-off undertone that continues to weigh especially on tech-related benchmarks like the Nasdaq, which is down nearly 3% over 30 days. This mix of AI disruption concerns, sector-specific stress overseas, and heightened fear gauges keeps volatility bid and tempers any aggressive risk-on follow-through.",
      "Sector and thematic flows are also being shaped by changing expectations around growth and inflation-sensitive assets. Crude oil's 10.49% 30-day rise and gold's 14.62% surge over the same period point to demand for both growth and hedge assets, though gold's 1.53% drop on the day hints at some unwinding of extreme safety trades after the CPI-induced relief. Together with a slightly weaker U.S. dollar over 30 days (-1.32%), these moves suggest markets are responding to a combination of softer inflation expectations, ongoing geopolitical and policy uncertainty, and rotation across asset classes rather than a single dominant macro driver."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** In the next 24 hours, a specific named macro data release or major U.S. central bank event is not identified in the provided information, so the primary scheduled catalyst appears to be company-specific earnings such as Costamare Inc.'s Q4 2025 results release and conference call on February 18, 2026 before the U.S. market open. That report could influence shipping and transport sentiment at the margin but is unlikely to move broad U.S. benchmarks on its own. Broader market direction is therefore likely to remain driven by follow-through positioning to the recent U.S. CPI data and ongoing digestion of the prior global selloff rather than a single discrete event in the next day.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Given the mixed signals, the most likely near-term direction is sideways. Spot U.S. indices show modest gains with an average 1-day rise of about 0.23% and strong small-cap performance, but futures across the S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell are slightly negative and the VIX is elevated and rising (+6.0% on the day). With 10-year yields drifting lower on supportive CPI news but no major new catalyst flagged for the next 24 hours, markets are likely to consolidate recent moves rather than trend decisively up or down.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Into the next session, traders should watch how U.S. index futures trade relative to recent cash closes, particularly S&P futures around 6,833 and Nasdaq futures near 24,642, as both are modestly below prior levels and will signal whether overnight sentiment stabilizes or deteriorates. The elevated VIX at 21.84 is another key gauge; a move higher from here would confirm renewed risk-off pressure, while a pullback toward the low-20s or below would support the flat-to-slightly-positive equity bias implied by recent spot performance.",
      "Sector-wise, the divergence between small caps and large-cap tech is important: the Russell 2000's strength at 2,646.7 versus the lagging Nasdaq Composite at 22,546.7 frames the current rotation. Traders should monitor whether small caps can hold their recent 1.18% daily gain and 6.64% 30-day advance, as any reversal there could drag broader risk sentiment. On the macro side, continued movement in the 10-year yield around 4.06%, as well as gold near 4,945 and WTI crude near 63.33, will help indicate if the post-CPI, lower-yield environment remains supportive or if rising volatility begins to pull capital back toward safer assets.",
      "Overnight, attention should also stay on global equity reactions, particularly in Asia and India, where recent reports highlighted significant selloffs tied to AI disruption fears and broad sector weakness. If those markets stabilize or rebound, it would reinforce a consolidation/flat outlook for U.S. equities; further declines abroad could pressure U.S. futures and challenge the current small-cap leadership. Watching how the U.S. dollar trades around 97.12, after a 1.32% 30-day decline, can also provide color on cross-border risk appetite and potential flows into or out of U.S. assets."

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

[
    "Across U.S. equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with selective strength. The S&P 500 and Dow were modestly higher on the day (around +0.05% and +0.10%), while small caps led with the Russell 2000 up 1.18%, and average index performance across the board was +0.23%. However, tech-heavy benchmarks are lagging, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.22% on the day and off 1.56% over the week, keeping overall risk appetite from being outright robust.",
    "Volatility and futures paint a more defensive picture. The VIX is elevated at 21.84 and jumped 6.0% on the day and over 50% in 30 days, signaling persistent demand for protection despite the modest equity gains. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all slightly negative on the most recent session (ranging from about -0.08% to -0.65%), suggesting fading risk appetite into the next trade date even as spot indices closed mixed to higher.",
    "Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed but lean mildly supportive for risk. The 10-year Treasury yield is down 1.17% on the day and 5.12% over the week to 4.06%, consistent with the recent U.S. CPI release that "supported the outlook for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year" and has helped lift Asian equity sentiment. At the same time, safe-haven gold is pulling back 1.53% on the day after a strong 14.62% 30-day run, while crude is higher on the day and up 10.49% over 30 days, indicating some reflationary or growth-linked positioning even as equity volatility stays elevated."
  ]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately constructive but not robust. Breadth is slightly positive with 8 assets up and 7 down, and the average 1-day index move of about +0.23% shows a gentle upward bias rather than a strong advance. The drop in the 10-year yield to 4.06% over the past week (-5.12%) provides a supportive backdrop for equities, but the VIX at 21.84 and up more than 50% over 30 days signals ongoing stress and hedging demand. Overall, conditions are better than a risk-off tape, but elevated volatility and recent weekly declines in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suggest a somewhat fragile equilibrium.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership has rotated toward cyclicals and smaller caps. Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear standout, gaining 1.18%, while the Dow also outperforms with a 0.10% rise and has added 2.99% over 30 days. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is the notable laggard with a 1-day decline of 0.22% and a 7-day drop of 1.56%, and Nasdaq futures are off 0.65% on the latest print, highlighting tech weakness. This pattern shows small caps and value/cyclical exposures leading near term, while growth/tech benchmarks struggle.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** [
    "A key macro driver is the recent U.S. inflation data, which has "supported the outlook for Federal Reserve rate cuts this year" and improved sentiment in Asian equities. This backdrop helps explain why U.S. yields have declined (10-year down 5.12% over the week) and why global risk appetite has not fully rolled over despite elevated volatility. The prospect of eventual policy easing is a risk-on catalyst, but the still-high VIX and only modest gains in the S&P 500 suggest investors are balancing rate-cut hopes against ongoing macro uncertainty.",
    "At the same time, global equity sentiment remains fragile after a recent "Friday the 13th" selloff in stocks and gold tied to AI-related fears and broader risk aversion, as highlighted by multiple reports of broad-based declines in Indian equities and sector-wide weakness. That episode, along with commentary that Goldman's Panic Index is nearing "max fear," reflects a risk-off undertone that continues to weigh especially on tech-related benchmarks like the Nasdaq, which is down nearly 3% over 30 days. This mix of AI disruption concerns, sector-specific stress overseas, and heightened fear gauges keeps volatility bid and tempers any aggressive risk-on follow-through.",
    "Sector and thematic flows are also being shaped by changing expectations around growth and inflation-sensitive assets. Crude oil's 10.49% 30-day rise and gold's 14.62% surge over the same period point to demand for both growth and hedge assets, though gold's 1.53% drop on the day hints at some unwinding of extreme safety trades after the CPI-induced relief. Together with a slightly weaker U.S. dollar over 30 days (-1.32%), these moves suggest markets are responding to a combination of softer inflation expectations, ongoing geopolitical and policy uncertainty, and rotation across asset classes rather than a single dominant macro driver."
  ]

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** In the next 24 hours, a specific named macro data release or major U.S. central bank event is not identified in the provided information, so the primary scheduled catalyst appears to be company-specific earnings such as Costamare Inc.'s Q4 2025 results release and conference call on February 18, 2026 before the U.S. market open. That report could influence shipping and transport sentiment at the margin but is unlikely to move broad U.S. benchmarks on its own. Broader market direction is therefore likely to remain driven by follow-through positioning to the recent U.S. CPI data and ongoing digestion of the prior global selloff rather than a single discrete event in the next day.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Given the mixed signals, the most likely near-term direction is sideways. Spot U.S. indices show modest gains with an average 1-day rise of about 0.23% and strong small-cap performance, but futures across the S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell are slightly negative and the VIX is elevated and rising (+6.0% on the day). With 10-year yields drifting lower on supportive CPI news but no major new catalyst flagged for the next 24 hours, markets are likely to consolidate recent moves rather than trend decisively up or down.

3.2. **Watch List:** [
    "Into the next session, traders should watch how U.S. index futures trade relative to recent cash closes, particularly S&P futures around 6,833 and Nasdaq futures near 24,642, as both are modestly below prior levels and will signal whether overnight sentiment stabilizes or deteriorates. The elevated VIX at 21.84 is another key gauge; a move higher from here would confirm renewed risk-off pressure, while a pullback toward the low-20s or below would support the flat-to-slightly-positive equity bias implied by recent spot performance.",
    "Sector-wise, the divergence between small caps and large-cap tech is important: the Russell 2000's strength at 2,646.7 versus the lagging Nasdaq Composite at 22,546.7 frames the current rotation. Traders should monitor whether small caps can hold their recent 1.18% daily gain and 6.64% 30-day advance, as any reversal there could drag broader risk sentiment. On the macro side, continued movement in the 10-year yield around 4.06%, as well as gold near 4,945 and WTI crude near 63.33, will help indicate if the post-CPI, lower-yield environment remains supportive or if rising volatility begins to pull capital back toward safer assets.",
    "Overnight, attention should also stay on global equity reactions, particularly in Asia and India, where recent reports highlighted significant selloffs tied to AI disruption fears and broad sector weakness. If those markets stabilize or rebound, it would reinforce a consolidation/flat outlook for U.S. equities; further declines abroad could pressure U.S. futures and challenge the current small-cap leadership. Watching how the U.S. dollar trades around 97.12, after a 1.32% 30-day decline, can also provide color on cross-border risk appetite and potential flows into or out of U.S. assets."

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {\n  &quot;1.0&quot;: [\n    &quot;Across U.S. equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with selective strength. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow were modestly higher on the day (around +0.05% and +0.10%), while small caps led with the Russell 2000 up 1.18%, and average index performance across the board was +0.23%. However, tech-heavy benchmarks are lagging, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.22% on the day and off 1.56% over the week, keeping overall risk appetite from being outright robust.&quot;,\n    &quot;Volatility and futures paint a more defensive picture. The VIX is elevated at 21.84 and jumped 6.0% on the day and over 50%
