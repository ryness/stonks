  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is improving, with equities broadly higher and volatility easing. The S&P 500 gained 0.81% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.01%, and the Russell 2000 added 0.71%, while 13 of 15 tracked assets advanced and the average index move was about +0.84%. The VIX fell 5.63% on the day to 14.58 and is down 21.44% over 30 days, signaling a more constructive risk backdrop.
  
  Equity futures confirm the risk-on tone, with S&P futures up 0.72%, Nasdaq futures up 1.08%, Dow futures up 0.46%, and Russell futures up 0.63% over the last session. Rates are stable to slightly supportive, with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.29% on the day to 4.17% even though it is up 4.22% over 30 days. This mix of rising equities, firm futures, and falling near-term volatility points to strengthening risk appetite in the short term despite a higher-yield backdrop over the past month.
  
  Cross-asset signals from commodities and FX are consistent with a moderate risk-on environment rather than outright stress. Gold futures are up 1.51% on the day and 9.13% over 30 days, and WTI crude is higher by 2.15% on the day, while the US Dollar index is only modestly firmer at +0.20% on the day and slightly lower over 30 days. The combination of strong equities and rising gold suggests investors are adding risk but still maintaining some hedges against macro or geopolitical uncertainty.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid, with 13 instruments up versus only 2 down and an average 1-day index gain of about 0.84%. All major US benchmarks are green on the day, led by the Nasdaq Composite at +1.01% and the S&P 500 at +0.81%, while small caps (Russell 2000) also participate with a 0.71% rise, indicating decent breadth across size segments. The VIX is low and falling on the day at 14.58 (-5.63%), suggesting calmer conditions, and the 10Y Treasury yield is slightly lower on the session at 4.17% even though it remains higher over 30 days. Overall, the tape reflects a healthy, risk-supportive environment with broad participation but occurring against a medium-term backdrop of somewhat higher rates.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the QQQ ETF up 1.17% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.01%, while Nasdaq futures gained 1.08%. On a weekly basis, small caps are the standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.87% and Russell futures up 4.65%, outpacing large-cap indices like the S&P 500 (+1.18% 7d) and Dow 30 (+2.40% 7d). On the downside, the main laggard in percentage terms today is the Dow futures contract at +0.46%, underperforming the Nasdaq and Russell complexes, and the only notable negative mover is the VIX, which fell 5.63% as volatility sold off alongside the equity rally.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and geopolitical themes center on shifting risk sentiment in Asia and ongoing reassessment of US growth and policy. Recent coverage notes that Asian stocks have fallen as optimism fades and traders digest mixed US economic data and a changing geopolitical backdrop, even as US bonds hold prior gains. This divergence—softness in Asian equities against firm US indices and a stable 10Y yield at 4.17%—suggests that while global risk appetite is uneven, the US market is currently in a more risk-on posture, supported by resilience in domestic data and earnings narratives. Geopolitics and policy uncertainty remain in the background but are not visibly derailing US risk-taking today. News flow highlights continued focus on Venezuela-related developments, tariff policies, and wider geopolitical tensions, but US indices are advancing and volatility is lower, implying that markets see these as manageable rather than acute shocks for now. At the same time, strong moves in gold (+1.51% 1d, +9.13% 30d) and oil (+2.15% 1d) indicate that some investors are positioning for macro or geopolitical risk, tempering but not reversing the prevailing risk-on tone in equities. Broader macro narratives include robust US economic performance and the AI-driven growth theme, which continue to underpin equity demand. Articles referencing US GDP expanding at a fast pace and persistent enthusiasm around AI—such as new AI-related Gmail features and ongoing AI stock focus—support the idea that growth and productivity stories are keeping investors engaged in cyclical and tech exposures. This backdrop aligns with the current pattern of leadership from the Nasdaq and QQQ complex and supports a risk-on interpretation of today's tape despite lingering concerns about future rate paths and geopolitical developments.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, a key potential trigger is the upcoming US Supreme Court hearing on Trump's tariff powers, which could significantly affect equities and bonds depending on whether the court curtails or upholds existing tariff authority. A ruling seen as limiting tariffs could be interpreted as risk-on for global trade-exposed sectors, while a decision preserving broad tariff powers might reinforce uncertainty and weigh on cyclicals. In addition, markets will remain sensitive to any fresh geopolitical headlines around Venezuela and broader conflict flashpoints mentioned in recent coverage, as these could quickly impact energy prices and risk sentiment. No specific major economic data or Fed events are flagged in the provided data for the next 24 hours, so tape action is likely to hinge on legal and geopolitical news flow rather than scheduled macro releases.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The bias for the next 24 hours leans modestly higher, as all major US equity indices are positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.81%, Nasdaq Composite +1.01%, Russell 2000 +0.71%), futures are also higher (e.g., Nasdaq futures +1.08%), and the VIX is down 5.63% to 14.58, signaling supportive risk sentiment. Breadth is strong with 13 assets up and an average index gain of about 0.84%, while the 10Y yield is slightly lower on the day at 4.17%, easing immediate rate pressure. The main risk to this constructive setup is event risk from the impending Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs and any geopolitical surprises, which tempers confidence but does not outweigh the current risk-on configuration in the data.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can build on today's gains, with attention on S&P futures around the 7,012 level and Nasdaq futures near 25,965 as reference marks for sustaining the uptrend. Continued outperformance in QQQ (+1.17% 1d) and the Nasdaq Composite (+1.01% 1d) versus the Dow (+0.53% 1d) would confirm that growth and AI-linked leadership remain intact, consistent with an upside bias. A further decline or stabilization in the VIX near the 14–15 zone would support the case for incremental risk-on positioning. Traders should also monitor small caps and cyclicals via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which have strong 7-day gains of 4.87% and 4.65%, respectively, as a sustained bid there would signal broadening risk appetite. On the macro side, the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.17% is a key reference; holding or drifting lower would be equity-friendly, while a sharp move higher could challenge the up-bias. Finally, the Supreme Court's tariff deliberations and any related headlines, alongside moves in gold (+1.51% 1d) and WTI crude (+2.15% 1d), should be tracked closely as barometers of shifting geopolitical and policy risk that could either reinforce or interrupt the current positive tone.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Risk appetite is improving, with equities broadly higher and volatility easing. The S&P 500 gained 0.81% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.01%, and the Russell 2000 added 0.71%, while 13 of 15 tracked assets advanced and the average index move was about +0.84%. The VIX fell 5.63% on the day to 14.58 and is down 21.44% over 30 days, signaling a more constructive risk backdrop.

Equity futures confirm the risk-on tone, with S&P futures up 0.72%, Nasdaq futures up 1.08%, Dow futures up 0.46%, and Russell futures up 0.63% over the last session. Rates are stable to slightly supportive, with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.29% on the day to 4.17% even though it is up 4.22% over 30 days. This mix of rising equities, firm futures, and falling near-term volatility points to strengthening risk appetite in the short term despite a higher-yield backdrop over the past month.

Cross-asset signals from commodities and FX are consistent with a moderate risk-on environment rather than outright stress. Gold futures are up 1.51% on the day and 9.13% over 30 days, and WTI crude is higher by 2.15% on the day, while the US Dollar index is only modestly firmer at +0.20% on the day and slightly lower over 30 days. The combination of strong equities and rising gold suggests investors are adding risk but still maintaining some hedges against macro or geopolitical uncertainty.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid, with 13 instruments up versus only 2 down and an average 1-day index gain of about 0.84%.

The VIX is low and falling on the day at 14.58 (-5.63%), suggesting calmer conditions, and the 10Y Treasury yield is slightly lower on the session at 4.17% even though it remains higher over 30 days. Overall, the tape reflects a healthy, risk-supportive environment with broad participation but occurring against a medium-term backdrop of somewhat higher rates.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the QQQ ETF up 1.17% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.01%, while Nasdaq futures gained 1.08%. On a weekly basis, small caps are the standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.87% and Russell futures up 4.65%, outpacing large-cap indices like the S&P 500 (+1.18% 7d) and Dow 30 (+2.40% 7d).
