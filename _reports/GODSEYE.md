  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-on but not euphoric. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are all up modestly on the day (+0.10%, +0.07%, +0.14%), while the Russell 2000 is essentially flat (-0.00%), pointing to a cautiously positive bias rather than a broad surge. Over the past week, cyclicals and smaller caps have outperformed (Russell 2000 +2.67%, Dow +1.28%), suggesting improving risk appetite beneath a relatively subdued headline tape.
  
  Volatility and futures markets reinforce this constructive but still-wary tone. The VIX has fallen 4.5% over the past day and 4.9% over the week, although it remains about 30% higher than 30 days ago, indicating that while immediate fear is easing, the background risk premium is still elevated. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all up 0.43–0.67% on the latest print, signaling a supportive near-term bias toward risk assets after a softer week in index futures.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are consistent with an incremental improvement in risk appetite. The 10-year Treasury yield is down 3.75% over the week and 3.22% over the month to 4.05%, easing some pressure on equity valuations. At the same time, classic hedges like gold (+1.14% 1d, +11.31% 30d) and oil (+7.25% 30d) are firm, and the US dollar is slightly softer over 7–30 days, all pointing to a market that is cautiously adding risk but still pricing in lingering macro uncertainty.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately positive. Breadth is constructive, with 11 assets up and only 4 down on the day, and the average 1d index move is a small gain of about 0.06%, suggesting a gentle but broad-based bid rather than a narrow rally. The VIX has dropped nearly 4.5% on the day while the 10-year yield continues to grind lower over the week and month, easing financial conditions at the margin. Taken together, the tape points to a market that is stabilizing after prior volatility, with improving but not exuberant risk sentiment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from small caps and cyclicals via derivatives, with Russell 2000 futures up 0.43% and Nasdaq futures up 0.67%, while the cash Nasdaq Composite is also positive at +0.14%. On the laggard side, QQQ is slightly negative on the day at -0.10%, indicating some softness in mega-cap tech relative to the broader market. Over the week, the Russell 2000 cash index is a clear standout at +2.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.17%) and Nasdaq futures (-0.91%) are relative underperformers, underscoring a rotation away from the prior tech leadership.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Recent macro and geopolitical drivers in the provided news flow are largely centered outside the US, with Indian equities showing notable volatility and sector rotation. Headlines describe the Sensex and Nifty rebounding strongly on February 16 after prior declines, with financials, energy, and pharma advancing while autos lagged. Earlier reports highlighted Indian markets selling off on fears around AI disruption in IT and broad-based weakness across metals, private banks, and energy, which is a risk-off signal for that region but does not directly show up in the US benchmarks given the lack of specific US-linked catalysts in the data. Global cross-currents around sentiment and risk perception also feature in the background. Articles reference a prior global selloff tied to AI-related fears and a "Panic Index" approaching high stress levels, indicating that investors have recently been quick to de-risk on negative headlines. However, the current US cross-asset configuration—lower VIX on the week, falling 10-year yields, and modest equity gains—suggests that this earlier bout of risk-off behavior is fading for now, even if it leaves a residual caution that caps the upside. Other individual news items, such as BlackRock Canada ETF distributions and various opinion pieces, are more micro or thematic in nature and do not provide clear, market-moving macro catalysts for US assets in this snapshot. With no fresh US-specific economic data or policy headlines in the feed, the tape appears to be driven predominantly by positioning and mean-reversion after prior volatility rather than a discrete macro shock, tilting the balance toward cautious risk-on behavior.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The modest but broad-based gains across major US indices, positive futures performance (S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures all up roughly 0.43–0.67%), easing front-end volatility (VIX -4.5% on the day), and a gently lower 10-year yield collectively point to an environment where dip-buying and stabilization are more likely than renewed selling over the next 24 hours. While elevated 30-day VIX levels and strong gold prices argue for underlying caution, the prevailing short-term momentum and supportive rate backdrop tilt the balance toward a slightly higher market rather than flat or down.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should focus on whether index futures can hold their current gains and translate them into follow-through in the cash market. For the S&P 500, the key watchpoint is whether it can build on the recent 0.10% daily gain and the current 0.59% advance in S&P futures; sustained strength there would validate the short-term bullish bias implied by the futures curve. The Russell 2000, up 2.67% over the week and with futures higher by 0.43% on the day, is another important tell—continued outperformance would confirm that investors are adding risk down the cap spectrum rather than crowding back into a narrow group of large caps. Sector and style leadership will also be critical to monitor against the backdrop of falling yields and a still-elevated but declining VIX. The underperformance of QQQ on the day (-0.10% vs. SPY +0.16%) suggests some digestion in mega-cap tech, so traders should watch whether Nasdaq futures (+0.67%) can drive a reversal there or if rotation into small caps and cyclicals persists. On the macro side, the 10-year Treasury yield hovering near 4.05% remains a key barometer: continued drift lower would support higher-equity valuations and the "up" bias, while any abrupt backup in yields or rebound in the VIX from 19.38 would be an early warning that the short-term risk-on tone is at risk.

## 1. Pulse

Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-on but not euphoric. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are all up modestly on the day (+0.10%, +0.07%, +0.14%), while the Russell 2000 is essentially flat (-0.00%), pointing to a cautiously positive bias rather than a broad surge.
