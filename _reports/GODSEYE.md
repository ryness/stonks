  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is moderately risk-on with a tilt toward large-cap growth. The S&P 500 and Dow are up about 0.2% on the day, while the Nasdaq outperforms at +0.31% and QQQ gains 0.41%, pointing to ongoing leadership from tech and growth. Small caps are the main blemish, with the Russell 2000 down 0.38% on the day despite being up 2.25% over the week, suggesting some near-term fading of risk appetite in higher-beta domestic names even as the broader tape grinds higher.","Volatility and futures reinforce a constructive backdrop. The VIX is down 2.35% on the day and almost 17% over the week to 15.4, consistent with a calm, risk-on environment. S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are all higher on the day (roughly +0.17% to +0.43%) and 1.4%–2.6% over the week, indicating investors are willing to add exposure into strength, while only Russell futures are modestly negative on the day. This combination points to an improving risk appetite overall, albeit concentrated in large-cap and tech benchmarks.","Rates and cross-asset signals show some tension but have not derailed the risk tone. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 0.75% on the day and about 3.4% over the week to 4.14%, a meaningful back-up that could normally pressure equities, yet indices have still advanced around 1.5%–2.8% over the week. Gold is up 1.8% over the week and crude is up 3.7%, while the dollar is slightly softer over seven days, together suggesting a backdrop of risk-on in equities and commodities with a mild bid for hedges, but no clear flight-to-safety dynamic."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid but not euphoric based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive, with 11 assets up versus 3 down and 1 flat, and the average 1-day index move is a moderate +0.16%, led by the Nasdaq and Dow while only the Russell 2000 lags. The VIX dropping to 15.4, down 2.3% on the day and 17% over the week, confirms a low-stress volatility regime. The main caution is the 10-year yield rising to 4.14% (up 0.75% on the day and 3.4% over the week), which tightens financial conditions at the margin even as equities continue to grind higher.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is clearly in large-cap growth and tech, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.31% on the day and 2.40% over the week, and QQQ gaining 0.41% today and 2.72% over the week, making it a standout gainer. The Dow is also strong with a 1-day move of +0.22% and a 30-day gain of 2.61%, showing steady blue-chip participation. On the downside, small caps are the notable laggard: the Russell 2000 fell 0.38% today (even though it is up 2.25% over the week), and Russell futures are off 0.44% on the day, signaling weaker appetite for smaller, higher-beta names in the very near term.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro data around U.S. inflation is the primary driver of the tape. Headlines note that the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow are rising as Fed-favored PCE inflation data cools, and S&P futures have been gaining into this key release, which is supportive of a risk-on bias as it underpins expectations for a patient or less hawkish Federal Reserve. Futures-related coverage also highlights that traders are focused on PCE as a determinant for the upcoming Fed decision, tying softer inflation directly to the current equity strength and lower volatility backdrop.","Broader macro and structural themes are also shaping sentiment. Coverage of a K-shaped U.S. economy underscores that stronger spending from wealthier households is supporting services and jobs, while lower-income consumers remain under strain, yet Bank of America still forecasts steady growth and no recession, which helps sustain risk appetite in equities. At the same time, global commentary about excess liquidity potentially fueling market bubbles and crypto volatility, including Bitcoin's early-December plunge in a "risk-off start," shows pockets of concern, but these have not translated into broad equity stress given the week's 1.5%–2.8% gains in major U.S. indices.","International developments and policy expectations round out the macro picture. Indian market coverage points to RBI policy and rupee weakness as local drivers, while globally investors are watching next week's Fed decision, with some reports describing U.S. stocks as little changed recently due to limited catalysts ahead of that meeting. Taken together, cooling U.S. PCE inflation and expectations of steady global growth are currently tilting the tape risk-on, even though rising U.S. yields and isolated risk-off moves in crypto remind traders that conditions could tighten if data or policy disappoints."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** In the next 24 hours, the key potential mover is the U.S. PCE inflation report, highlighted in multiple headlines as the Fed's preferred gauge and a central input for the upcoming Dec. 10 policy decision; a cooler print, as already suggested in today's coverage, tends to reinforce equity gains and keep volatility suppressed, while a surprise re-acceleration could lift yields and pressure risk assets. Markets are also focused on weekly U.S. jobless claims and consumer sentiment data, which one pre-open summary flags as near-term catalysts shaping views on growth and Fed policy; stronger labor and sentiment data could support cyclicals and keep yields elevated, whereas weaker readings might favor defensives and duration. No major single-stock earnings catalysts are cited in the provided data, so index-level moves are likely to hinge primarily on these macro prints and any accompanying Fed-related commentary referenced in news flows.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, as major indices and futures are already trending higher (S&P 500 +0.19%, Nasdaq +0.31%, Dow +0.22% today; S&P and Nasdaq futures +0.17% and +0.43% respectively) and the VIX is down 2.3% on the day and 17% on the week, signaling strong risk appetite. Cooling PCE inflation, explicitly linked in headlines to today's equity strength, supports expectations for a less hawkish Fed and has so far outweighed the drag from a 10-year yield that is up 0.75% on the day and 3.4% on the week. The main risk to this bias is the back-up in yields and underperformance in small caps (Russell 2000 -0.38% on the day), but breadth, futures, and volatility still favor a slight upside skew.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether large-cap tech leadership continues, as the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ have outperformed with 1-day gains of 0.31% and 0.41% and 7-day gains of 2.40% and 2.72% respectively, while S&P futures are pushing toward all-time highs per futures commentary. Sustained strength in Nasdaq futures (+0.43% on the day, +2.58% on the week) relative to Russell futures (-0.44% on the day) will be an important tell for whether the market remains in a growth-led, mega-cap-driven advance consistent with the projected upward bias.","Overnight, monitor the behavior of the 10-year Treasury yield, now at 4.14% and up 3.7% over 30 days, alongside the VIX at 15.4, down nearly 11% over the month; an ongoing combination of contained volatility and stable-to-slightly softer yields would support further equity upside, while a sharp yield spike could challenge it. On the macro side, any revisions or market reactions to the PCE inflation data and related Fed expectations, as well as follow-on commentary in futures markets about the upcoming Fed decision, will be key to confirming whether the current grind higher in the S&P 500 (+1.54% over 7 days) and Dow (+1.79% over 7 days) can extend into the next session.","Sector and style rotations also warrant attention, particularly the divergence between small caps and the rest of the tape: the Russell 2000 is down 0.38% on the day despite a strong 2.25% gain over the week, and Russell futures are off 0.44% on the day. If small caps stabilize or turn higher alongside still-firm crude (+0.69% on the day, +3.68% on the week) and gold (+1.78% over the week), it would signal broader participation in the risk-on move; continued small-cap weakness, by contrast, would suggest the rally remains concentrated and more vulnerable to any negative macro surprise."]

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, as major indices and futures are already trending higher (S&P 500 +0.19%, Nasdaq +0.31%, Dow +0.22% today; S&P and Nasdaq futures +0.17% and +0.43% respectively) and the VIX is down 2.3% on the day and 17% on the week, signaling strong risk appetite. Cooling PCE inflation, explicitly linked in headlines to today's equity strength, supports expectations for a less hawkish Fed and has so far outweighed the drag from a 10-year yield that is up 0.75% on the day and 3.4% on the week. The main risk to this bias is the back-up in yields and underperformance in small caps (Russell 2000 -0.38% on the day), but breadth, futures, and volatility still favor a slight upside skew.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether large-cap tech leadership continues, as the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ have outperformed with 1-day gains of 0.31% and 0.41% and 7-day gains of 2.40% and 2.72% respectively, while S&P futures are pushing toward all-time highs per futures commentary.

If small caps stabilize or turn higher alongside still-firm crude (+0.69% on the day, +3.68% on the week) and gold (+1.78% over the week), it would signal broader participation in the risk-on move; continued small-cap weakness, by contrast, would suggest the rally remains concentrated and more vulnerable to any negative macro surprise."]

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Across equities, the tone is moderately risk-on with a tilt toward large-cap growth.
