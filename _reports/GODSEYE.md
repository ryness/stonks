  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite improved on the day as equities rebounded broadly and small caps led: S&P 500 +0.98%, Dow +1.08%, Nasdaq +0.88%, and Russell 2000 +2.80%. Futures echoed the tone (ES +0.96%, YM +1.08%, NQ +0.72%, RTY +2.80%), while the VIX fell 11.32% to 23.43 and the 10Y Treasury yield eased 1.05% to 4.06%, a supportive combo for stocks in the near term.
  
  Despite today’s bounce, the weekly risk tone remains subdued: major indices are still down over 7 days (Nasdaq -4.84%, Dow -4.16%, S&P -3.62%, Russell -3.31%) and the VIX is 33.81% higher week-over-week. Commodities were mixed-to-soft (WTI -1.83% on the day; Gold +0.50% but -3.04% on the week), and the US Dollar was slightly firmer over 7 days (+0.70%), underscoring lingering caution beneath the day’s relief rally.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market breadth was constructive with 12 up, 3 down, 0 flat and an average index gain of 1.25% on the day, signaling a healthy rebound across benchmarks. Volatility cooled but remains elevated with the VIX at 23.43, down 11.32% today but still up 33.81% over the week. The 10Y Treasury yield dipped to 4.06% (-1.05% 1d), providing a tailwind to equities in the session. Overall market health is improving tactically today but remains fragile in a weekly context given the still-elevated volatility backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to small caps and cyclicals today with the Russell 2000 up 2.80%, while mega-cap tech lagged on a relative basis (QQQ +0.75%). Over the week, the Nasdaq Composite is the negative standout at -4.84% 7d as AI-linked weakness persisted, whereas the Russell 2000 is the relative leader with a smaller 7d decline of -3.31%. Outside equities, WTI crude was a notable laggard on the day at -1.83%, contrasting with the equity bounce.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI valuation concerns remain a key macro theme, with headlines highlighting wobbling sentiment around the AI trade and Nvidia’s continued decline dragging tech. This pressure has contributed to the Nasdaq’s underperformance over the week (-4.84% 7d) and a higher VIX on a weekly basis (+33.81% 7d), skewing risk toward risk-off when AI enthusiasm fades. Cross-asset weakness in commodities and crypto is also in focus, with reports of sliding oil and metals alongside crypto softness. WTI crude’s 1.83% drop today and gold’s negative 7d move (-3.04%) align with a cautious growth and liquidity tone, which can cap risk appetite even as equities bounce. Currency dynamics and emerging-market stress add another layer, with the Indian rupee’s sharp decline against the US dollar and the dollar’s steady 7d rise (+0.70%). A firm dollar and EM currency pressure typically dampen global risk sentiment, helping explain why the VIX remains elevated on a weekly horizon despite today’s pullback.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55%: Today’s broad bounce (avg index +1.25%, small caps +2.80%) and a 1.05% dip in the 10Y yield support near-term stability, while an 11.32% drop in VIX eases immediate stress. However, the 7d drawdowns (Nasdaq -4.84%, Dow -4.16%) and a VIX still up 33.81% week-over-week, plus AI/commodity headwinds in the news flow, argue for limited follow-through and a more range-bound next session.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P 500 holds near its last close at 6,602.99 and ES futures around 6,620.25; sustaining levels near those marks would support a consolidation bias consistent with a flat call. Monitor the VIX around 23; further slippage from 23.43 would favor stability, while a rebound toward the prior day’s reference near 26 would flag renewed risk-off. Track leadership: Russell 2000 at 2,369.59 versus Nasdaq proxies (QQQ 590.07). Continued small-cap resilience alongside a still-soft QQQ (+0.75% 1d; -4.99% 7d) would point to rotation rather than broad risk expansion, aligning with a range-bound session. Keep an eye on macro levers: the 10Y Treasury at 4.06%, WTI crude at 58.06, and the US Dollar at 100.18. A steady-to-softer yield and contained dollar would underpin equity stability, while further oil weakness or dollar strength could pressure cyclicals and tilt the tape away from sustained upside.
