  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a mixed but net positive tone: the S&P 500 rose 0.21% and the Dow 30 outperformed at 1.18%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.25% and the Russell 2000 inched up 0.11%. Breadth favored gainers (11 up vs 4 down) and the average index change was +0.20%, indicating risk appetite is modestly improving even as growth/tech underperformed (QQQ -0.27% on the day and Nasdaq -1.08% over 7d).
  
  Volatility eased at the margin with VIX at 17.19 (-0.52% 1d), though it remains 5.5% higher over 30 days, signaling lingering caution beneath the surface. Futures are constructive with S&P (+0.39%) and Nasdaq (+0.70%) leading, suggesting sentiment has stabilized after the cash-session tech drag.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed: the 10Y Treasury yield edged up to 4.12% (+0.24% 1d) and the US Dollar firmed 0.15% 1d, while Gold advanced 0.57% and WTI Crude fell 0.92%. The combination points to a cautiously risk-on backdrop supported by rotation, but with ongoing hedging and a bid to defensives.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive. Breadth was supportive (11 up vs 4 down) and the average index change of +0.20% shows a constructive, if modest, advance. Volatility eased on the day with VIX at 17.19 (-0.52% 1d) but remains higher over 30 days, hinting at residual risk. The 10Y at 4.12% (+0.24% 1d) keeps financial conditions roughly steady, consistent with a rotational, not exuberant, tape.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to value and cyclicals with the Dow 30 up 1.18% on the day and up 0.77% over the week, while the S&P 500 gained 0.21%. Laggards were growth/tech, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.25% on the day and off 1.08% over the week, and the Russell 2000 also softer over 7 days (-0.85%).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Tech/AI sentiment softened after headlines that SoftBank sold a $5.83 billion Nvidia stake and CoreWeave issued weak guidance, with the XLK tech fund down nearly 1% in the cited session. This pressured the Nasdaq and growth benchmarks, tilting the tape risk-off within tech even as broader indices held up. A weak ADP jobs report noting private payrolls down 11,000 per week signaled slowing growth, a mixed catalyst that can dampen cyclicals but also temper rate fears. The immediate cross-asset response was limited, with the 10Y yield still up 0.24% on the day to 4.12%, underscoring only a mild easing in macro anxiety. Policy risk receded as the Senate passed a bill to end the shutdown, which the reports said boosted sentiment even as markets remained cautious. This reduction in tail risk supported Dow leadership and a modestly risk-on tilt outside of mega-cap tech.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%: Overnight futures are higher (S&P +0.39%, Nasdaq +0.70%, Dow +0.17%) and VIX eased to 17.19 (-0.52% 1d), while breadth improved (11 up vs 4 down) and the average index change was +0.20%. Although tech remains a headwind (Nasdaq -0.25% 1d), the Senate’s shutdown-averting bill supports sentiment, making a modest upside bias most likely.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether tech stabilizes: QQQ fell 0.27% while Nasdaq futures are up 0.70%; sustained trade in NQ=F above 25,821 would support a rebound, while failure there argues for continued rotation into Dow leaders. Also monitor ES=F around 6,898.5; holding gains into the open would align with the ‘up’ bias. Track rates and vol for confirmation: the 10Y sits at 4.12% (+0.24% 1d) and VIX at 17.19 (-0.52% 1d); further VIX drift lower and a steady 10Y would underpin risk. Breadth staying positive (today 11 up vs 4 down) would validate constructive tone beyond mega-cap tech. Cross-asset tells: energy may face pressure with WTI at 60.48 (-0.92% 1d), while Gold at 4,130.40 (+0.57% 1d) and the US Dollar at 99.61 (+0.15% 1d) flag ongoing hedging. If oil stabilizes and gold cools alongside firmer equities, it would strengthen the case for a broader risk-on session.
