  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities show a mixed-to-negative tone with a clear tilt away from large-cap growth and toward cyclicals and small caps. The S&P 500 is down 0.53% on the day while still up 0.97% over 7d, and the Nasdaq is off 1.22% on the day and down 3.55% over 30d, indicating fading risk appetite in tech and growth. In contrast, the Dow eked out a 0.08% gain and the Russell 2000 added 0.49%, with small caps up 1.64% over 30d, signaling rotation rather than broad risk-on. Overall, the average index change of about -0.50% reflects a modest risk-off day.","Volatility and futures corroborate the cautious tone. The VIX is up 4.91% on the day to 18.81, though still down 7.29% over the week but 17.71% higher over 30d, pointing to a near-term uptick in hedging demand on top of a structurally higher volatility backdrop. S&P futures are down 0.62% and Nasdaq futures down 1.36% on the day versus only a 0.04% gain in Dow futures and a 0.45% rise in Russell futures, underscoring that risk appetite is fading specifically in growth-heavy benchmarks while remaining more resilient in value and small caps.","Rates and cross-asset moves send a more nuanced signal. The 10Y Treasury yield is lower by 3.69% over 30d to 4.02% and down 0.77% on the day, typically supportive for equities, yet the concurrent strength in gold (+13.57% over 30d) and oil (+7.05% over 30d) plus a modestly firmer dollar over 7d suggest some defensive and inflation-hedging behavior. Taken together, risk appetite looks to be rotating and selectively fading in high-duration assets rather than improving broadly."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately fragile, with an average 1d index change of about -0.50% despite slightly positive breadth (8 assets up vs 7 down). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell today while the Dow and Russell 2000 rose, indicating underlying support but also meaningful dispersion. The VIX's 4.91% jump today, atop a 17.71% rise over 30d, points to investors paying up for protection even as the 10Y Treasury yield drifts lower by 3.69% over 30d to 4.02%. Overall, the market looks mixed but not distressed, with healthier conditions in cyclicals and small caps offset by pressure in large-cap growth and elevated volatility pricing.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day and week has tilted toward small caps and value while large-cap tech lags. The Russell 2000 is a clear positive standout, up 0.49% on the day and 1.13% over 7d, with Russell futures similarly higher by 0.45% on the day and 0.98% over 7d. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is a notable laggard with a -1.22% 1d move and -3.55% over 30d, echoed by QQQ's -1.27% 1d decline. Over the week, major benchmarks like the S&P 500 (+0.97% 7d) and Nasdaq (+1.29% 7d) remain positive, but today's tape clearly favors Dow and Russell leadership against tech-heavy indices.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["unknown","unknown"]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence; today's average index decline of about -0.50%, led by the Nasdaq's -1.22% and S&P 500's -0.53% drops, alongside S&P and Nasdaq futures down 0.62% and 1.36% respectively, points to a short-term risk-off tone. The VIX's 4.91% jump and its elevated 30d gain of 17.71% indicate rising demand for protection despite lower 10Y yields, which would normally support equities. Leadership is rotating into the Russell 2000 and Dow while large-cap growth sells off, suggesting de-risking from the prior winners rather than broad risk-on. With no explicit positive catalysts in the provided data and growth benchmarks under pressure, the balance of evidence favors modest downside bias over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should monitor the growth-heavy benchmarks where pressure is most acute, particularly the Nasdaq Composite around its latest close of 22,869.31 and the QQQ ETF near 608.84, given their 1d declines of roughly 1.2–1.3%. S&P 500 cash and futures (last 6,909.47 and 6,916.50 respectively) are also key reference points; sustained trading below these levels would confirm that today's risk-off bias is extending rather than reversing. The relative resilience of the Dow (49,521.79) and Russell 2000 (2,676.42) should be watched for signs of whether rotation into value and small caps continues or if weakness broadens out.","Overnight and into the next session, focus on cross-asset risk signals such as the VIX at 18.81, the 10Y yield near 4.02%, and gold and oil which have been strong over 7–30 days. A further rise in the VIX from today's 4.91% jump, combined with continued strength in gold (+13.57% over 30d) and elevated crude (+7.05% over 30d), would support the risk-off, "down" bias. Conversely, stabilization or pullback in volatility and safe-haven assets, along with S&P and Nasdaq futures reclaiming today's losses, would be early indications that downside momentum is easing despite the current cautious tone."]

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

["Equities show a mixed-to-negative tone with a clear tilt away from large-cap growth and toward cyclicals and small caps. The S&P 500 is down 0.53% on the day while still up 0.97% over 7d, and the Nasdaq is off 1.22% on the day and down 3.55% over 30d, indicating fading risk appetite in tech and growth. In contrast, the Dow eked out a 0.08% gain and the Russell 2000 added 0.49%, with small caps up 1.64% over 30d, signaling rotation rather than broad risk-on. Overall, the average index change of about -0.50% reflects a modest risk-off day.","Volatility and futures corroborate the cautious tone. The VIX is up 4.91% on the day to 18.81, though still down 7.29% over the week but 17.71% higher over 30d, pointing to a near-term uptick in hedging demand on top of a structurally higher volatility backdrop. S&P futures are down 0.62% and Nasdaq futures down 1.36% on the day versus only a 0.04% gain in Dow futures and a 0.45% rise in Russell futures, underscoring that risk appetite is fading specifically in growth-heavy benchmarks while remaining more resilient in value and small caps.","Rates and cross-asset moves send a more nuanced signal. The 10Y Treasury yield is lower by 3.69% over 30d to 4.02% and down 0.77% on the day, typically supportive for equities, yet the concurrent strength in gold (+13.57% over 30d) and oil (+7.05% over 30d) plus a modestly firmer dollar over 7d suggest some defensive and inflation-hedging behavior. Taken together, risk appetite looks to be rotating and selectively fading in high-duration assets rather than improving broadly."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately fragile, with an average 1d index change of about -0.50% despite slightly positive breadth (8 assets up vs 7 down). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell today while the Dow and Russell 2000 rose, indicating underlying support but also meaningful dispersion. The VIX's 4.91% jump today, atop a 17.71% rise over 30d, points to investors paying up for protection even as the 10Y Treasury yield drifts lower by 3.69% over 30d to 4.02%. Overall, the market looks mixed but not distressed, with healthier conditions in cyclicals and small caps offset by pressure in large-cap growth and elevated volatility pricing.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day and week has tilted toward small caps and value while large-cap tech lags. The Russell 2000 is a clear positive standout, up 0.49% on the day and 1.13% over 7d, with Russell futures similarly higher by 0.45% on the day and 0.98% over 7d. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is a notable laggard with a -1.22% 1d move and -3.55% over 30d, echoed by QQQ's -1.27% 1d decline. Over the week, major benchmarks like the S&P 500 (+0.97% 7d) and Nasdaq (+1.29% 7d) remain positive, but today's tape clearly favors Dow and Russell leadership against tech-heavy indices.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["unknown","unknown"]

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence; today's average index decline of about -0.50%, led by the Nasdaq's -1.22% and S&P 500's -0.53% drops, alongside S&P and Nasdaq futures down 0.62% and 1.36% respectively, points to a short-term risk-off tone. The VIX's 4.91% jump and its elevated 30d gain of 17.71% indicate rising demand for protection despite lower 10Y yields, which would normally support equities. Leadership is rotating into the Russell 2000 and Dow while large-cap growth sells off, suggesting de-risking from the prior winners rather than broad risk-on. With no explicit positive catalysts in the provided data and growth benchmarks under pressure, the balance of evidence favors modest downside bias over the next 24 hours.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should monitor the growth-heavy benchmarks where pressure is most acute, particularly the Nasdaq Composite around its latest close of 22,869.31 and the QQQ ETF near 608.84, given their 1d declines of roughly 1.2–1.3%. S&P 500 cash and futures (last 6,909.47 and 6,916.50 respectively) are also key reference points; sustained trading below these levels would confirm that today's risk-off bias is extending rather than reversing. The relative resilience of the Dow (49,521.79) and Russell 2000 (2,676.42) should be watched for signs of whether rotation into value and small caps continues or if weakness broadens out.","Overnight and into the next session, focus on cross-asset risk signals such as the VIX at 18.81, the 10Y yield near 4.02%, and gold and oil which have been strong over 7–30 days. A further rise in the VIX from today's 4.91% jump, combined with continued strength in gold (+13.57% over 30d) and elevated crude (+7.05% over 30d), would support the risk-off, "down" bias. Conversely, stabilization or pullback in volatility and safe-haven assets, along with S&P and Nasdaq futures reclaiming today's losses, would be early indications that downside momentum is easing despite the current cautious tone."]
