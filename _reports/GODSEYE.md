  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-25T10:26:42.980163+00:00">2025-11-25 10:26 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 28s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad rebound with the S&P 500 up 1.55%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2.69%, and the Russell 2000 up 1.89%, while the Dow 30 lagged at +0.44%, indicating an intraday tilt back toward growth and beta. SPY gained 1.47% and QQQ rose 2.56%, reflecting strong megacap tech participation and an improvement in risk appetite during the cash session.
  
  Volatility remains elevated and firmed despite the equity rally, with the VIX at 20.70, up 0.88% on the day and 4.39% over the week, signaling persistent hedging demand and an undercurrent of caution. This keeps the risk backdrop balanced rather than euphoric.
  
  Overnight futures softened modestly, with S&P futures -0.17%, Nasdaq futures -0.32%, Dow futures -0.12%, and Russell futures -0.09%, tempering the earlier risk-on tone. Rates were supportive, as the 10Y Treasury yield fell 0.62% on the day to 4.04% and is down 1.80% over the week, a combination that typically aids duration‑sensitive equities.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive. Breadth was slightly positive at 8 up versus 7 down, and the average index change across benchmarks was a robust 1.76%, led by growth. However, VIX at 20.70 and higher on both 1-day and 7-day horizons flags residual stress. The 10Y Treasury yield easing to 4.04% supports risk assets, especially tech, but elevated volatility argues for measured optimism.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to growth with the Nasdaq Composite up 2.69% on the day (QQQ +2.56%), while the Dow 30 was the notable laggard at +0.44%. Over the past week, the Russell 2000 leads at +1.31% and the Dow 30 lags at -2.13%, with the S&P 500 modestly lower at -0.48%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Rising expectations for a December US rate cut and a near-term data waiting period are framing the tape, as highlighted by coverage noting stocks rising ahead of key data for the Fed outlook and reports that comments from New York Fed President John Williams boosted rate cut bets. This aligns with supportive rates moves, with the 10Y yield down 1.80% over the week and aiding the risk-on tilt seen in growth equities. AI and megacap tech sentiment remains a visible driver, with positive NVIDIA-focused coverage and broader ‘everything rally’ narratives coinciding with the Nasdaq’s 2.69% gain and QQQ up 2.56%. Offsetting forces include crypto pressure and a firming volatility backdrop, with the VIX up 4.39% over the week, which tempers but does not negate risk appetite.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The cash session showed strong risk-on participation (S&P 500 +1.55%, Nasdaq +2.69%), but overnight futures are modestly lower (ES -0.17%, NQ -0.32%) and VIX remains elevated and rising on a 7-day basis to 20.70. Easing rates (10Y at 4.04%, -0.62% on the day) are supportive, yet the mix of firmer volatility and slight futures softness suggests consolidation rather than directional follow-through.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Overnight, monitor equity futures relative to their last prints: ES 6,709.75 (-0.17%), NQ 24,868.00 (-0.32%), YM 46,459.00 (-0.12%), and RTY 2,416.60 (-0.09%). Stabilization or a turn higher would support a flat-to-firm open, while further slippage would challenge the cash-session gains. Watch volatility and rates as the key macro dials: VIX at 20.70 has been rising on a 7-day basis and a push higher would pressure risk, whereas a steady or lower VIX alongside the 10Y holding near 4.04% would underpin growth-heavy benchmarks. Within equities, track whether tech leadership persists (Nasdaq Composite +2.69%, QQQ 605.16) and if small caps can follow through (Russell 2000 2,414.28, 7d +1.31%) as confirmation of broader risk appetite. A sustained divergence with the Dow 30 (+0.44% 1d, -2.13% 7d) would signal narrow leadership and argue for caution.
