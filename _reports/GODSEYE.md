  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are in a clear risk-on rebound with broad strength and a tech bias. The S&P 500 rose 0.88%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.31%, and the Russell 2000 added 0.86%, while the average 1d index move across benchmarks is about 0.94%. Futures echo this positive tone, with S&P futures up 1.61% and Nasdaq futures up 2.18% on the day, signaling improving risk appetite after a soft prior week (e.g., S&P 500 -0.76% and Nasdaq -1.46% over 7d).","Volatility is compressing sharply, reinforcing the risk-on message. The VIX fell 11.62% on the day and is down 23.54% over 30 days to 14.91, indicating investors are pricing in lower near-term equity risk premia even as indices hover near recent highs. This decline in implied volatility alongside broad index gains quantifies a meaningful improvement in sentiment.","Rates and cross-asset moves show some nuance but do not yet undermine the constructive tone. The 10Y Treasury yield ticked up 0.85% on the day to 4.15% yet is modestly lower over 7d (-0.31%), suggesting no abrupt rate shock. At the same time, defensive assets like gold are rallying strongly (gold futures +1.10% 1d, +10.24% 30d) and crude remains weak over 7–30 days, indicating some lingering macro hedging even as equity risk appetite improves in the short term."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong in the very near term based on the benchmark changes and breadth. Breadth is positive with 14 instruments up and only 1 down, and the average 1d index gain of roughly 0.94% points to a broad-based advance rather than a narrow squeeze. The sharp 11.62% drop in VIX to 14.91 signals calmer conditions and supportive liquidity, while the 10Y yield's small 0.85% move higher to 4.15% stays within recent ranges. Taken together, this mix suggests a healthy, risk-on tape tactically, even if some 7d index metrics remain slightly negative.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the Nasdaq Composite up 1.31% and QQQ up 1.30%, while Nasdaq futures gained 2.18%. Small caps also outperform on the futures side, with Russell futures up 1.43% and the Russell 2000 cash index up 0.86%. On the lagging side for the day, the Dow 30 is the relative underperformer among major U.S. indices at +0.38%, and crude oil remains weak on a trend basis despite a modest 0.66% daily bounce, with WTI down 3.32% over 7d and 4.90% over 30d.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The primary macro theme driving the tape is a tech-led risk-on move in global equities tied to shifting central bank dynamics. News flow highlights that U.S. stocks rallied with strength in tech, with the S&P 500 up 0.88%, the Dow up 0.38%, and the Nasdaq up 1.31%, while Asian markets followed Wall Street higher after Japan's rate hike. This combination of a tech rebound and markets digesting higher but still-manageable rates has boosted risk appetite, as evidenced by gains in Nasdaq futures (+2.18%) and a sharply lower VIX (-11.62% on the day).","Another key macro backdrop is global central bank policy and currency moves, particularly the Bank of Japan's rate hike and related dollar strength. Multiple headlines emphasize Japan's move to a three-decade high in policy rates and a firmer U.S. dollar (Dollar Index +0.29% 1d), with yen weakness noted even after the hike. This environment supports a cross-asset rotation where global investors lean into equities and crypto (reports of Bitcoin and ether popping higher as Japanese rate changes lift Asian risk appetite), encouraging a risk-on tilt in the short term despite slightly higher bond yields (10Y +0.85% 1d).","At the same time, there are ongoing narratives around an AI/tech correction normalizing and selective de-risking that temper exuberance. Coverage of a "global selloff in stocks" signaling an AI bubble cooling, and Michael Burry's prominent tech shorts, points to a backdrop where froth in specific names is being challenged even as broad indices push higher. This dynamic favors broad-market risk-on sentiment but with a more discerning tone toward overextended growth stocks, which may explain why indices can rally while gold (+4.55% 7d, +10.24% 30d) and other hedges remain well-bid as a macro insurance layer."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours include corporate earnings such as Darden Restaurants' and FedEx's scheduled reports, which could impact consumer and logistics sentiment and thus broader equity risk tone. Markets will also continue to react to the recent Bank of Japan rate hike and any follow-on commentary, as this has already influenced global bond yields and risk appetite. Additionally, traders will watch for further U.S. macro data and jobs-related signals referenced in recent coverage, as these can shift expectations for the path of interest rates and thereby move S&P and Nasdaq futures.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based index gains today (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%), strong futures performance (Nasdaq futures +2.18%, S&P futures +1.61%), and a sharp drop in VIX (-11.62%). While 7d performance is slightly negative for several indices, the combination of improving tech sentiment, supportive global risk appetite after the Bank of Japan decision, and upcoming but not clearly adverse earnings catalysts tilts the bias to a continuation of the rebound rather than an immediate reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether major equity benchmarks can build on today's gains and hold above recent levels implied by futures (e.g., S&P futures at 6,887 and Nasdaq futures at 25,575). The behavior of the VIX around the mid-teens is key; sustaining levels near or below 15 after an 11.62% single-day drop would confirm that the volatility reset is sticking and support further grind higher in indices. Monitoring breadth relative to today's strong 14-up/1-down split will also be important to see if the rally remains broad-based or narrows back into mega-cap tech only.","Sector-wise, focus should stay on tech and growth proxies like QQQ (+1.30% 1d) and the Nasdaq Composite (+1.31% 1d), as they are leading the risk-on move and will likely dictate the tape if sentiment shifts. Macro-wise, keep an eye on the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15% and the dollar at 98.72; a stable to slightly softer dollar and contained yields would align with the expected upward bias, while a sharp backup in rates could quickly challenge it. Finally, watch gold's elevated trajectory (up over 10% in 30d) as a signal of underlying macro concern; if gold cools while equities extend, that would reinforce a cleaner risk-on environment, whereas further gold strength alongside rising yields could cap equity upside even if the near-term direction remains up."]

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based index gains today (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%), strong futures performance (Nasdaq futures +2.18%, S&P futures +1.61%), and a sharp drop in VIX (-11.62%).
