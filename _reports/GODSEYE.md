  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities the tone is broadly risk-on, with major US indices up around 1.2% on the day and small caps leading: the S&P 500 gained 1.17%, the Dow 1.22%, the Nasdaq 1.20%, and the Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.85% rise. However, the weekly picture is more mixed, as the S&P 500 is down 1.29% and the Nasdaq is off 1.87% over 7 days, while the Russell 2000 has risen 2.67%, indicating improving risk appetite skewed toward domestically oriented and smaller-cap names after a recent pullback.
  
  Volatility and futures also signal an improvement in risk appetite. The VIX fell 15.48% on the day to 16.98, even though it remains 17.18% higher over the past week and about 10% higher over 30 days, suggesting today's relief rally follows a period of elevated concern. Equity futures are solidly higher, with S&P futures up 1.36%, Nasdaq futures up 1.69%, Dow futures up 1.33%, and Russell futures up 1.82% on the day, reinforcing the pro-risk tone in the near term despite modest 7-day declines in large-cap futures.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals point to a cautiously supportive backdrop rather than outright euphoria. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped 0.98% on the day to 4.25% but is still up about 1.97% over the week and 2.75% over 30 days, indicating that equity strength is occurring alongside a still-firm rate environment. At the same time, traditional havens like gold continue to attract interest, with gold futures up 0.82% on the day, 6.86% over 7 days, and 13.90% over 30 days, suggesting that while risk appetite is improving in the short run, investors are also maintaining hedges against macro or geopolitical uncertainty.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks constructive in the very short term, with breadth showing 12 assets up versus 3 down and an average 1-day index move of about +0.79%. Major equity benchmarks are all positive on the day, led by the Russell 2000's 1.85% gain, while the S&P 500 and Dow both advance just over 1%. The sharp 15.48% drop in the VIX back toward the high teens, alongside a modest 0.98% decline in the 10-year yield, points to easing immediate stress after a bumpier prior week. Taken together, the tape appears short-term healthy but still operating within a higher-volatility, higher-yield regime than a month ago.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from small caps and tech-linked benchmarks: the Russell 2000 is the clear standout with a 1.85% gain, and Nasdaq futures and the QQQ ETF are also strong, up 1.69% and 1.36%, respectively. Over the past week, the Russell complex again leads, with the Russell 2000 index up 2.67% and Russell futures up 2.66%, while large-cap indices like the S&P 500 and Dow are down 1.29% and 0.86%. On the laggard side, the Nasdaq Composite is weaker on a 7-day view, down 1.87%, and SPY is a notable underperformer on the day with a 2.04% decline, standing out negatively against the broader index gains.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Trade policy and tariff uncertainty remain a key macro theme, but today's data show markets reacting more to an easing of immediate fears than to new shocks. News that the US Supreme Court has delayed a ruling on Trump-era tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act keeps a cloud of legal uncertainty over trade, yet the lack of a fresh adverse decision appears to coincide with a risk-on day in US equities and a 15.48% drop in the VIX. This suggests that, for now, the absence of new negative tariff headlines is allowing risk assets to recover, even as the overall 7-day declines in the S&P 500 and Dow remind traders that trade and tariff risk remain an overhang. Geopolitical tension around Trump's tariff threats and the subsequent futures moves described in international coverage also frame the backdrop, with prior reports of US stock futures and gold reacting sharply to tariff rhetoric. In the current snapshot, US equity futures are higher by 1.33% to 1.82% across major contracts while gold is also up 0.82% on the day and nearly 14% over 30 days. This combination indicates markets are treating the latest geopolitical developments as a partial de-escalation in the very near term (risk-on for equities), but persistent demand for gold underscores that investors still see meaningful medium-term geopolitical and macro risk. Commodity and regional dynamics are influencing sentiment at the margin. Natural gas has recently surged 29% on forecasts of an Arctic blast in the US, which helps explain the resilience in energy-related risk appetite alongside WTI crude's 2.50% gain over 7 days, a setup that can be modestly supportive for US energy equities. In contrast, Indian equity indices such as the Sensex and Nifty have faced sharp declines tied to weak IT earnings and global trade concerns, signaling that global risk sentiment is uneven and that ongoing trade and growth worries can still exert a risk-off pull outside the US even as US benchmarks bounce.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets are likely to focus on any additional headlines around US trade policy and tariffs, particularly developments related to Trump's previously threatened measures and pending Supreme Court deliberations, as these could quickly shift risk sentiment. Traders will also watch for follow-up commentary from global political forums and policymakers that might clarify the trajectory of US-European trade relations, which have recently driven sharp swings in US futures and safe-haven assets like gold. Corporate news and earnings updates highlighted in recent coverage, such as large-cap consumer and tech names, could further influence sector leadership and either reinforce or challenge today's risk-on tone.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (S&P 500 +1.17%, Dow +1.22%, Nasdaq +1.20%, Russell 2000 +1.85%) and confirming strength in futures (S&P +1.36%, Nasdaq +1.69%, Dow +1.33%, Russell +1.82%). The 15.48% drop in the VIX alongside a small decline in the 10-year yield suggests easing immediate stress, which typically supports follow-through buying. While 7-day returns for large-cap indices remain negative and macro risks around tariffs and global growth are unresolved, the combination of strong breadth (12 up vs 3 down) and firm overnight futures tilts the short-term balance toward further upside rather than a swift reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and futures can hold today's gains and build on the 1.17% and 1.36% advances, respectively, as sustained strength would validate an emerging short-term uptrend after a weak week. The Russell 2000 and Russell futures, up 1.85% and 1.82% on the day and more than 2.6% over the week, are key barometers of risk-on appetite; continued outperformance there would signal that investors are rotating into higher-beta small caps rather than simply short-covering large caps. On the macro side, monitoring the VIX and 10-year Treasury yield will be critical to confirming the bullish bias. If the VIX, now at 16.98 after a 15.48% drop, stays contained or drifts lower and the 10-year yield remains near or below 4.25% after its 0.98% daily decline, that would support further multiple expansion in equities. Traders should also track gold, which is elevated after a 13.90% 30-day gain, as any renewed surge alongside equity weakness could flag a quick swing back toward risk-off if fresh tariff or geopolitical headlines emerge. Sectorally and cross-asset, attention should be on tech and growth proxies like the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ (up 1.20% and 1.36% on the day) to see if they can reverse their negative 7-day performance, as well as on energy-linked assets given recent strength in WTI crude (+2.50% over 7 days) and weather-driven natural gas moves referenced in the news. Persistently strong performance in these cyclical and growth-sensitive areas, combined with stable or softer dollar moves (the dollar index is little changed over 30 days), would be consistent with the forecasted upward bias into the next trading day.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Across equities the tone is broadly risk-on, with major US indices up around 1.2% on the day and small caps leading: the S&P 500 gained 1.17%, the Dow 1.22%, the Nasdaq 1.20%, and the Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.85% rise. However, the weekly picture is more mixed, as the S&P 500 is down 1.29% and the Nasdaq is off 1.87% over 7 days, while the Russell 2000 has risen 2.67%, indicating improving risk appetite skewed toward domestically oriented and smaller-cap names after a recent pullback.

Volatility and futures also signal an improvement in risk appetite. The VIX fell 15.48% on the day to 16.98, even though it remains 17.18% higher over the past week and about 10% higher over 30 days, suggesting today's relief rally follows a period of elevated concern. Equity futures are solidly higher, with S&P futures up 1.36%, Nasdaq futures up 1.69%, Dow futures up 1.33%, and Russell futures up 1.82% on the day, reinforcing the pro-risk tone in the near term despite modest 7-day declines in large-cap futures.

Rates and cross-asset signals point to a cautiously supportive backdrop rather than outright euphoria. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped 0.98% on the day to 4.25% but is still up about 1.97% over the week and 2.75% over 30 days, indicating that equity strength is occurring alongside a still-firm rate environment. At the same time, traditional havens like gold continue to attract interest, with gold futures up 0.82% on the day, 6.86% over 7 days, and 13.90% over 30 days, suggesting that while risk appetite is improving in the short run, investors are also maintaining hedges against macro or geopolitical uncertainty.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks constructive in the very short term, with breadth showing 12 assets up versus 3 down and an average 1-day index move of about +0.79%. Major equity benchmarks are all positive on the day, led by the Russell 2000's 1.85% gain, while the S&P 500 and Dow both advance just over 1%. The sharp 15.48% drop in the VIX back toward the high teens, alongside a modest 0.98% decline in the 10-year yield, points to easing immediate stress after a bumpier prior week. Taken together, the tape appears short-term healthy but still operating within a higher-volatility, higher-yield regime than a month ago.

Over the past week, the Russell complex again leads, with the Russell 2000 index up 2.67% and Russell futures up 2.66%, while large-cap indices like the S&P 500 and Dow are down 1.29% and 0.86%. On the laggard side, the Nasdaq Composite is weaker on a 7-day view, down 1.87%, and SPY is a notable underperformer on the day with a 2.04% decline, standing out negatively against the broader index gains.
