  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone has turned risk-on in the very near term, with all major U.S. benchmarks up about 1.2% on the day (S&P 500 +1.16%, Dow +1.21%, Nasdaq +1.18%) and small caps outperforming (Russell 2000 +2.00%). However, this comes after a weak week for the large-cap indices (S&P 500 -1.30%, Nasdaq -1.89% over 7d), so the rally is more a rebound than a fresh breakout. Risk appetite is improving day-over-day but remains mixed on a one-week horizon.","Volatility and futures confirm a tentative restoration of risk appetite. The VIX is down 4.67% on the day to 16.11, partially reversing a 6.55% rise over the past week, while S&P and Nasdaq futures are modestly higher (+0.53% and +0.79% on 1d, respectively). In rates, the 10Y Treasury yield has dipped 0.98% on the day to 4.25% but is still up 1.97% over 7d and 2.75% over 30d, indicating that the rally is occurring against a backdrop of somewhat higher yields than a month ago, which tempers the strength of the risk-on signal.","Cross-asset signals outside equities are more cautious, with safe-haven gold near recent highs despite a flat day (-0.12% 1d, but +4.82% 7d and +15.26% 30d) and crude oil slightly softer on the day (-0.81%) but higher over the month. The U.S. dollar is essentially unchanged on all horizons (about flat 1d and slightly negative over 7d and 30d), suggesting FX is not providing a strong directional cue. Overall, risk appetite is improving in the last 24 hours but remains constrained by lingering demand for hedges and recent rate and volatility upticks."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately constructive in the short term, with breadth showing 11 assets up versus 4 down and an average 1-day index gain of about 1.34%. The strong rebound in the Russell 2000 (+2.00% 1d, +7.01% 30d) alongside solid moves in the S&P 500 and Dow suggests reasonably healthy participation beyond just mega-cap tech. At the same time, the VIX at 16.11 and down 4.67% on the day indicates easing but not exceptionally low volatility, while the 10Y yield at 4.25% is slightly off recent highs but still above month-ago levels. Taken together, conditions are healthier than during the recent selloff, but the backdrop of higher yields and elevated gold implies ongoing macro unease.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear equity leader with a +2.00% move, outpacing the S&P 500 (+1.16%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.18%), and its futures contract is likewise strong (+0.52% 1d). On the downside, commodities lag, with WTI crude down 0.81% and gold futures off 0.12% on the day despite their positive 7d and 30d trends. Over the past week, the Russell complex still leads (Russell 2000 cash +2.82%, Russell futures +2.85%), while the Nasdaq is the notable laggard (Nasdaq Composite -1.89%, QQQ -1.65% over 7d), underscoring recent rotation away from large-cap growth toward small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical tensions around U.S. President Trump's proposed Greenland tariffs remain a key overhang, with multiple headlines citing sharp equity and futures drawdowns tied to this rhetoric and broader U.S.-EU tensions. Reports note that U.S. stock futures had previously crashed more than 1.5% and that Wall Street tumbled over 2% as tariff threats escalated, contributing to a surge in safe-haven gold to record levels above $4,850 per ounce. These developments have been distinctly risk-off catalysts, pushing investors toward gold and away from risk assets until the latest rebound.","At the same time, the market is processing the aftermath of that "brutal sell-off" while awaiting and reacting to Trump's Davos speech and related meetings on the Greenland crisis, as highlighted by repeated references to futures "wavering" around his remarks. This uncertainty has amplified short-term volatility (reflected in the VIX's 6.55% rise over 7d despite today's pullback) and spurred a "Sell America" narrative in some coverage, which explains persistent demand for defensive assets like gold and Treasuries even as equities bounce. Overall, these themes frame the tape as a tug-of-war between geopolitical risk-off impulses and opportunistic dip-buying in equities."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the key potential market mover is further commentary or policy signaling from President Trump related to Greenland tariffs and associated U.S.-EU tensions, including follow-through from his Davos appearances highlighted in recent headlines. Any escalation in tariff threats or concrete policy actions could re-ignite risk-off selling in equities and support further strength in gold and possibly Treasuries, while signs of de-escalation or conciliatory language could underpin the current equity rebound and pressure safe havens. No specific major economic data releases or central bank decisions are cited in the provided information, so geopolitical communication risk appears to be the primary near-term trigger.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The most likely near-term direction appears flat with a mild upward bias, given that U.S. indices have already rebounded about 1.2% on the day and futures are only modestly higher (S&P futures +0.53%, Nasdaq futures +0.79%), suggesting some stabilization after prior heavy selling. The VIX's 4.67% drop and slightly lower 10Y yield (-0.98% 1d) support a calmer tape, but gold's still-elevated 7d and 30d gains and the recent geopolitical-driven selloffs show that macro risks remain firmly in play. With mixed signals—short-term risk-on in equities versus persistent demand for hedges and higher yields than a month ago—sideways trade with pockets of volatility is more probable than a strong directional move over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 can build on its 1.16% rebound and whether futures (ES last 6,946.75, +0.53% 1d) hold those gains in the face of any new tariff headlines. The Russell 2000 and its futures (RTY last 2,724.80, +0.52% 1d, +7.91% 30d) deserve particular attention as small caps have led on both a 1-day and 30-day basis; sustained outperformance there would reinforce the idea of improving domestic risk appetite despite recent macro stress.","On the macro side, monitor the VIX around the 16 area and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.25% for confirmation of a stable risk backdrop; renewed spikes in either would challenge the flat-to-slightly-positive equity bias. Gold futures near 4,826, after a 15.26% 30-day surge, are another key barometer—further upside would signal that safe-haven demand is intensifying again, potentially capping equity advances. Sector-wise, while the data are index-level only, the relative underperformance of the Nasdaq over 7 and 30 days suggests traders should watch whether large-cap tech and QQQ (-1.34% 30d) can regain leadership or continue to lag in favor of cyclicals and small caps."

["Across equities, the tone has turned risk-on in the very near term, with all major U.S. benchmarks up about 1.2% on the day (S&P 500 +1.16%, Dow +1.21%, Nasdaq +1.18%) and small caps outperforming (Russell 2000 +2.00%).

Risk appetite is improving day-over-day but remains mixed on a one-week horizon.","Volatility and futures confirm a tentative restoration of risk appetite. The VIX is down 4.67% on the day to 16.11, partially reversing a 6.55% rise over the past week, while S&P and Nasdaq futures are modestly higher (+0.53% and +0.79% on 1d, respectively).

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear equity leader with a +2.00% move, outpacing the S&P 500 (+1.16%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.18%), and its futures contract is likewise strong (+0.52% 1d). On the downside, commodities lag, with WTI crude down 0.81% and gold futures off 0.12% on the day despite their positive 7d and 30d trends. Over the past week, the Russell complex still leads (Russell 2000 cash +2.82%, Russell futures +2.85%), while the Nasdaq is the notable laggard (Nasdaq Composite -1.89%, QQQ -1.65% over 7d), underscoring recent rotation away from large-cap growth toward small caps.
