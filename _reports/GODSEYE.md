  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-20T15:24:32.069297+00:00">2025-11-20 15:24 UTC</time> (runtime 2m 16s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad, tech-led rebound, with the S&P 500 up 1.73%, Nasdaq Composite up 2.24%, Russell 2000 up 2.04%, and Dow 30 up 1.38% on the day; breadth was strong at 12 up versus 3 down and the average index change was 1.86%, signaling improving risk appetite.
  
  Volatility eased as VIX fell 16.06% to 19.86, though it remains elevated versus the past week and month (+14.93% and +20.88% respectively), while equity futures showed follow-through strength with S&P, Nasdaq, Russell, and Dow contracts up 1.28% to 1.97%, collectively pointing to a near-term risk-on tone.
  
  Rates were modestly supportive with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.60% to 4.11, the US Dollar dipped 0.07%, and commodities were slightly firmer (Gold +0.35%, WTI +0.44%), indicating risk appetite improved today but remains tempered by still-elevated volatility levels.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks improved tactically: breadth registered 12 up and 3 down, and the average index gain was a solid 1.86% across benchmarks. VIX fell 16% to 19.86, but it remains higher on a 7- and 30-day basis, signaling lingering fragility. The 10Y Treasury eased to 4.11 (-0.60% 1d), offering a supportive backdrop for equities. Overall, conditions are better in the short run, yet not fully healthy given negative 7-day trends and elevated volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to growth on the day, with the Nasdaq Composite up 2.24% and QQQ up 2.03%, while the Dow 30 lagged among majors at +1.38%. Over the past week, small caps and the Dow underperformed (Russell 2000 -2.54%, Dow 30 -2.40%) versus the S&P 500 (-1.31%) and Nasdaq Composite (-1.70%), highlighting ongoing cyclicals weakness.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Positioning into Nvidia’s earnings dominated the tape, with headlines flagging the print as a make-or-break moment for the AI trade; the 1-day outperformance in tech (Nasdaq +2.24%, QQQ +2.03%) and VIX compression suggest a risk-on reset ahead of the report. Recent global risk-off pressure tied to lofty AI valuations and fading rate-cut hopes, described as a “deadly confluence of wrong-way news,” left weekly damage intact (major US indices -1.3% to -2.6% over 7 days) and keeps sentiment fragile despite today’s bounce. A Japan bond market warning around a sizeable stimulus plan added a macro overhang, with concerns about debt sustainability acting as a potential risk-off catalyst even as US rates edged lower today (10Y 4.11, -0.60% 1d).
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings and guidance within the next session are the key swing factor for AI-linked risk appetite; a strong data-center outlook could support tech leadership, while disappointment could rekindle selling. US jobs data referenced in headlines is due and could move yields and equity multiples; softer results would typically aid risk assets via lower rates, while strength could pressure high-multiple tech. Walmart results mentioned as approaching could sway consumer and retail sentiment, with a resilient print supportive for the Dow and discretionary.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 58%: Broad-based gains (S&P 500 +1.73%, Nasdaq +2.24%, Russell 2000 +2.04%), VIX compression (-16% to 19.86), firmer futures (ES +1.65%, NQ +1.95%), and a slightly lower 10Y (4.11) tilt the near-term bias positive, though confidence is capped by negative 7-day trends and the binary Nvidia catalyst.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch equity futures for confirmation—ES=F near 6,771.5, NQ=F around 25,204, and RTY=F near 2,401—and whether VIX can hold below 20 (last 19.86) to sustain the risk-on tone. Monitor semis and mega-cap AI leadership into and after Nvidia’s print, using QQQ (last 612.02, +2.03% 1d) and the Nasdaq Composite (23,068.79, +2.24% 1d) as barometers; persistent outperformance would corroborate an up-bias, while reversal would warn of a failed bounce. Keep an eye on rates and the dollar—10Y Treasury at 4.11 and DXY at 100.16—as further yield softening and a stable dollar would support equities, whereas a backup in yields could pressure small caps (RUT 2,395.86, +2.04% 1d) and high-multiple tech.
