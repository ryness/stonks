  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-off under the surface despite small headline moves. The S&P 500 and SPY were essentially flat to slightly higher on the day (+0.03% and +0.04%), while the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ outperformed modestly (+0.28% and +0.32%), but the Dow fell -0.58% and the Russell 2000 dropped sharply (-1.82%). On a 7-day view, major US indices are all negative except the Russell 2000 (+1.37%), with the S&P 500 -0.69% and Nasdaq -0.88%, indicating fading risk appetite versus 30-day gains.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm a cautious tone. The VIX rose 2.88% on the day and is slightly higher on the week (+0.69%), even though it remains about 5% lower than 30 days ago, signaling some incremental hedging. Equity futures are soft: S&P futures -0.16% and Dow futures -0.76% on the day, with both down around 1% over 7 days, while Russell futures lag even more (-2.17% 1d). Nasdaq futures are a small outlier to the upside (+0.09% 1d) but still -0.87% over 7 days, pointing to selective, tech-focused risk-taking rather than broad risk-on.
  
  Rates and cross-asset moves suggest a defensive tilt. The 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day (-0.24%) but up 1.63% over the week, which, combined with rising VIX and a -0.29% average 1-day index decline across benchmarks, shows investors demanding a slightly higher risk premium. Strong rallies in classic hedges and cyclicals like gold (+1.51% 1d, +18.46% 30d) and WTI crude (+3.23% 1d, +5.20% 30d), alongside a weaker US dollar (-0.92% 1d, -1.69% 7d), are consistent with choppy, catalyst-driven positioning rather than an improving risk appetite.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks mixed but not stressed. Breadth is slightly positive (8 up vs 7 down), yet the average 1-day index move is negative at -0.29%, meaning gains are narrow and dominated by a few benchmarks like the Nasdaq while others, notably the Dow and Russell 2000, are under pressure. The VIX at 16.09 is relatively low but rising on the day and week, and the 10Y Treasury yield is modestly higher over 7 and 30 days, suggesting some rebuilding of risk premium. Overall, conditions are moderately healthy with stable volatility and no rates shock, but short-term momentum is soft and leadership is uneven.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, growth and large-cap tech are leading while cyclicals and small caps lag. The Nasdaq Composite is a positive standout at +0.28% with QQQ up +0.32%, whereas the Russell 2000 is the clear underperformer at -1.82% alongside Dow futures at -0.76%. On a 1-week basis, the Russell 2000 actually leads (+1.37% spot, +0.90% futures) and the Dow holds up reasonably well (-0.19% spot, -0.46% futures), while the S&P 500 (-0.69%) and Nasdaq (-0.88%) are negative, underscoring a rotation between small caps and megacap tech rather than broad, stable leadership.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and geopolitical drivers are centered on shifting tariff risk and easing, but not disappearing, Greenland-related tensions. Recent reports highlighted that US equities previously rallied as President Trump walked back tariff threats against eight European allies tied to the Greenland dispute, which had fueled a pronounced "Sell America" move and a 700+ point Dow drop earlier. The partial relief from these threats is modestly risk-on, but the current stall in US futures and negative Dow performance suggest investors are still cautious about policy reversals and geopolitical noise. Global equity sentiment is also being influenced by mixed regional tapes and flow dynamics. Indian markets, for example, saw the Sensex and Nifty fall around 0.95% with weekly losses driven by sustained foreign outflows and a mixed earnings season, even as Greenland tensions eased; this combination is risk-off for EMs and feeds into a broader narrative of selective de-risking. At the same time, US headlines note that Wall Street is regrouping after a volatile week defined by on-and-off Greenland messaging and disappointing Intel earnings, which underpins the defensive tilt in cyclicals and small caps despite modest strength in tech-heavy benchmarks. Cross-asset moves underscore a search for safety and hedges against US-specific risk. News flow points to central banks and investors increasingly hoarding gold as a hedge against dollar and US political risk, aligning with the strong surge in gold futures (+8.58% over 7 days and +18.46% over 30 days) and commentary about hedging against potential shifts in US primacy. This gold strength, combined with a weakening dollar and elevated focus on US tariff policy, leans risk-off at the macro level, even though equity indices are not in a disorderly selloff.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The next 24 hours lack specific, dated macro releases in the provided data, but several ongoing themes could move markets: further headlines on US tariff policy and Greenland-related negotiations, any new corporate earnings surprises (with Intel already flagged as a recent negative catalyst), and updates on foreign flows and earnings in key markets like India, where sustained outflows and mixed results have pressured indices. Additional commentary or data that shifts expectations for central bank gold buying or the US dollar trajectory, both highlighted in recent reports, could also impact risk sentiment via moves in gold, FX, and Treasury yields.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence – The average 1-day index move is negative (-0.29%) with clear weakness in cyclicals and small caps (Russell 2000 -1.82%, Russell futures -2.17%), while Dow futures are also soft (-0.76%) and the VIX is rising (+2.88% on the day). Macro news flow emphasizes lingering tariff and Greenland policy uncertainty plus weak foreign flows into markets like India, and gold is surging as a hedge. Tech strength in the Nasdaq (+0.28%, Nasdaq futures +0.09%) offers some support, but the combination of deteriorating breadth in futures, higher volatility, and defensive cross-asset positioning tilts the near-term bias modestly to the downside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should closely watch equity futures, especially S&P (6,933.75, -0.16% 1d) and Russell (2,671.50, -2.17% 1d), for confirmation of whether small-cap underperformance continues or stabilizes. Persistent weakness in Russell versus Nasdaq futures would validate the current risk-off, quality-growth preference and could foreshadow further pressure on cyclical sectors and domestic beta. Monitoring any shift in Nasdaq futures, which are currently only marginally higher on the day, will help gauge whether tech leadership can still offset broader de-risking. Rates, volatility, and cross-asset hedges also warrant attention as they align with the downside bias. The 10Y yield at 4.24%, up 1.63% over the week, combined with a VIX that is rising on the day and week, suggests sensitivity to any renewed tariff or geopolitical headlines; further upticks in either would likely pressure equities. In parallel, tracking gold around its elevated level (4,983.10, +1.51% 1d) and the US dollar at 97.46 (-0.92% 1d) will be important: continued gold strength and dollar softness in response to policy headlines or flow data would reinforce a risk-off regime and increase the odds that equity indices trade lower or struggle to rally.

## 1. Pulse

Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-off under the surface despite small headline moves. The S&P 500 and SPY were essentially flat to slightly higher on the day (+0.03% and +0.04%), while the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ outperformed modestly (+0.28% and +0.32%), but the Dow fell -0.58% and the Russell 2000 dropped sharply (-1.82%). On a 7-day view, major US indices are all negative except the Russell 2000 (+1.37%), with the S&P 500 -0.69% and Nasdaq -0.88%, indicating fading risk appetite versus 30-day gains.

Volatility and futures confirm a cautious tone. The VIX rose 2.88% on the day and is slightly higher on the week (+0.69%), even though it remains about 5% lower than 30 days ago, signaling some incremental hedging. Equity futures are soft: S&P futures -0.16% and Dow futures -0.76% on the day, with both down around 1% over 7 days, while Russell futures lag even more (-2.17% 1d). Nasdaq futures are a small outlier to the upside (+0.09% 1d) but still -0.87% over 7 days, pointing to selective, tech-focused risk-taking rather than broad risk-on.

Rates and cross-asset moves suggest a defensive tilt. The 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day (-0.24%) but up 1.63% over the week, which, combined with rising VIX and a -0.29% average 1-day index decline across benchmarks, shows investors demanding a slightly higher risk premium. Strong rallies in classic hedges and cyclicals like gold (+1.51% 1d, +18.46% 30d) and WTI crude (+3.23% 1d, +5.20% 30d), alongside a weaker US dollar (-0.92% 1d, -1.69% 7d), are consistent with choppy, catalyst-driven positioning rather than an improving risk appetite.

On a 1-week basis, the Russell 2000 actually leads (+1.37% spot, +0.90% futures) and the Dow holds up reasonably well (-0.19% spot, -0.46% futures), while the S&P 500 (-0.69%) and Nasdaq (-0.88%) are negative, underscoring a rotation between small caps and megacap tech rather than broad, stable leadership.
