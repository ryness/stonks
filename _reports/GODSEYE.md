  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed broad risk-off with the S&P 500 down 1.19%, Nasdaq Composite down 1.20%, Dow down 1.32%, and small caps underperforming as the Russell 2000 fell 2.07% on the day; over a week, the S&P 500 is -0.98% and the Russell 2000 is -3.31%. Breadth was weak (2 up, 13 down), indicating sellers dominated across benchmarks and sectors, signaling fading risk appetite.
  
  Volatility spiked, with VIX up 16.59% to 23.12 on the day and up 41.23% over 30 days, reinforcing a defensive tone. Equity futures echoed the cash weakness as S&P futures fell 1.29%, Nasdaq futures 1.29%, Dow futures 1.39%, and Russell futures 2.11% over 1d, pointing to continued pressure.
  
  Rates and FX were not a tailwind for risk: the 10Y Treasury yield slipped 0.36% to 4.13% on the day but is up 0.98% week-over-week, while the US Dollar rose 0.30% on the day. Commodities were soft with Gold -1.69% and WTI Crude -0.48% on the day, consistent with a cautious backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak, with an average index change of -1.37% and breadth skewed negatively (2 up, 13 down). Elevated volatility (VIX 23.12, +16.59% 1d) signals heightened risk aversion. The 10Y yield eased slightly on the day (-0.36% to 4.13%) but is higher over 7d (+0.98%), offering limited relief. Overall, breadth, downside momentum, and higher volatility indicate deteriorating conditions.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is skewed to the downside: small caps lagged most with the Russell 2000 down 2.07% on the day and -3.31% on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.20% today and -1.86% on the week. On the positive side, the US Dollar was a mild standout at +0.30% 1d (and VIX jumped +16.59% 1d), while WTI Crude (+0.62% 7d) and Gold (+0.97% 7d) were relative weekly leaders despite today’s pullback.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fading expectations for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts and messy, incomplete macro data have pressured risk assets. Headlines highlight investors paring rate-cut bets and a global selloff amid a data ‘fog’ following the US government shutdown, aligning with today’s higher VIX (+16.59%) and broad equity declines, a clear risk-off impulse. Tech leadership wobbled as AI valuation concerns resurfaced and attention turned to a key Nvidia report next week, damping sentiment toward growth indices. This theme maps to the Nasdaq Composite’s 1.20% drop today and QQQ’s 1.23% decline, reinforcing risk-off positioning in high-multiple tech.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% given broad equity declines (S&P 500 -1.19%, Russell 2000 -2.07%), futures weakness (ES -1.29%, NQ -1.29%), elevated volatility (VIX +16.59% to 23.12), and risk-off catalysts tied to rate-cut doubts and AI valuation jitters, with no supportive near-term triggers identified.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures around current marks for extension or stabilization: ES near 6,668, NQ near 24,769.75, and RTY near 2,345.40; continued relative weakness in small caps versus large caps would confirm risk-off, with the cash Russell 2000 at 2,338.80 as a key tell. Monitor volatility and rates for confirmation: VIX holding above ~23 keeps pressure on equities, while the 10Y at 4.13% (up 0.98% over 7d) and a firm US Dollar at 99.57 would remain headwinds to risk. A rise in yields or further dollar strength would likely reinforce downside. Focus on tech and AI proxies into the next session as sentiment drivers: QQQ at 601.38 and Nasdaq futures at 24,769.75 are critical risk gauges; continued softness would weigh on broader indices. Also track Gold at 4,018.50 and WTI at 59.80 for additional confirmation of defensive or growth concerns.
