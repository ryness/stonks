  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite improved notably today as equities rallied broadly and volatility eased. The S&P 500 rose 1.54% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.27%, while breadth showed 14 up vs. 1 down and the average index change was 1.56%. The VIX fell 7.76% to 17.60, signaling a risk-on tone versus Friday, even as it remains higher over 7 and 30 days.
  
  Futures echoed the strength: S&P futures climbed 1.62% and Nasdaq futures advanced 2.35%, reinforcing the pro-cyclical tilt led by tech. Small caps participated but lagged with Russell futures up 1.04%, and the Dow futures trailed at +0.82%, indicating leadership remains growth-oriented.
  
  Rates were a mild headwind, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.42% on the day to 4.11%, though it is down 0.75% over 30 days. The combination of lower spot volatility and higher equities alongside only a modest uptick in yields points to improving risk appetite today, tempered by the VIX’s 7-day rise (+4.08%) that keeps a layer of caution in the backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks constructive in the near term. Breadth was strong at 14 advancers to 1 decliner and the average index change was a robust 1.56%, led by the Nasdaq. Volatility eased with the VIX down 7.76% to 17.60, while the 10Y yield’s small uptick to 4.11% (+0.42% 1d) keeps financial conditions from easing too quickly. Taken together, the backdrop is healthy short term, though the VIX’s higher 7- and 30-day reads counsel vigilance.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed toward growth: the Nasdaq Composite led with a 1d gain of 2.27% and QQQ rose 2.21%, while the Dow lagged at +0.81% and the Russell 2000 trailed at +0.94%. Over the past week, SPY is a modest positive standout at +0.24%, whereas QQQ is a notable laggard at -0.45% and the Russell 2000 is down -0.42%. This mix underscores a tech-led rebound today against a still-soft weekly tape for growth and small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Recent tech volatility and valuation concerns remain central. Coverage highlighted the worst tech sell-off since April and ongoing valuation worries, and today’s rebound is consistent with a relief bid as the Nasdaq gained 2.27% and Nasdaq futures rose 2.35% (risk-on). The still-elevated VIX on a 7- and 30-day basis suggests that while sentiment improved today, the market remains sensitive to further headlines. Macro uncertainty around a cooling U.S. labor backdrop and policy noise continues to influence risk taking. Reports noted deteriorating jobs data and even government shutdown uncertainty weighing on sentiment last week, aligning with the VIX’s 7-day increase of 4.08% (risk-off). Today’s broad advance and lower VIX signal a swing back to risk-on, but the mixed weekly performance across indices shows that macro caution is not fully resolved. Valuation and economic concerns persist ahead of scheduled data and Fed remarks, as flagged in futures commentary. With the 10Y yield up slightly to 4.11% today and the US Dollar modestly firmer (+0.12% 1d), rate and growth expectations remain in focus (potentially risk-neutral to risk-off if upside surprises rekindle yield pressure).
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. confidence data and Fed speak are on tap, per futures commentary, and could sway risk sentiment; a stronger confidence print or dovish tone would likely support equities and suppress volatility, while a weak print or hawkish remarks could pressure growth stocks and lift yields.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% The broad equity rebound (S&P 500 +1.54%, Nasdaq +2.27%), supportive futures (ES +1.62%, NQ +2.35%), strong breadth (14 up, 1 down), and a 7.76% drop in VIX collectively tilt the next 24h bias upward. A slight 10Y rise to 4.11% and the VIX’s higher 7-day level temper conviction, but near-term momentum favors follow-through unless upcoming confidence data or Fed remarks flip the tone.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech leadership for confirmation: Nasdaq futures near 25,758 and QQQ’s ability to hold today’s gains will be key to sustaining risk-on. If ES holds the 6,863 area and NQ remains bid, breadth should stay positive; a reversal there would warn of a fade back to last week’s risk-off skew. Monitor volatility and rates as guardrails: VIX near 17.6 staying contained would support dips being bought, while a push higher would challenge the rally. The 10Y around 4.11% is a pivot; a move higher alongside a firmer US Dollar at 99.71 could pressure growth, while a stable-to-softer yield backdrop likely underwrites further gains. Into the data, focus on U.S. confidence prints and any Fed remarks noted in futures commentary for tape direction. Small caps (Russell futures 2,465.90) and cyclicals should be watched for participation; stronger engagement there would broaden the advance, while renewed small-cap underperformance would signal a narrower, more fragile move.
