  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on in the very near term but still fragile on a weekly basis. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are all higher on the day (+0.69%, +0.47%, and +0.90% respectively), while SPY and QQQ mirror that strength (+0.72% and +0.88%). However, over 7 days the majors are modestly negative (S&P 500 -0.47%, Dow -1.12%, Nasdaq -0.94%), showing that today's bid is more of a rebound than a clean uptrend.",
      "Volatility and futures confirm an improvement in risk appetite versus recent stress but from an elevated backdrop. The VIX fell sharply on the day (-5.6% to 19.09), but remains up 7.3% over 7 days and 24.1% over 30 days, indicating that fear has eased in the last session while still being structurally higher than a month ago. Equity index futures are aligned with spot, with S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures all up 0.44–0.84% on the day, though each is down around 0.5–0.6% over the past week; Russell futures are flat on the day and slightly negative over 7 days, reinforcing a risk tone that favors large caps and growth over small caps.",
      "Rates and cross-asset signals point to a mixed but not dysfunctional environment. The 10Y Treasury yield is nearly unchanged on the day (+0.27% to 4.09%) and lower over 7 and 30 days (around -1.3–1.5%), which provides some support for equity valuations. At the same time, traditional havens and inflation-sensitive assets are firm, with gold up 2.1% on the day and 14.2% over 30 days and WTI crude up 18.7% over 30 days, suggesting lingering macro and geopolitical concerns. Overall, risk appetite is improving on the day but still fading versus the past month, with average index gains of about 0.60% today against negative 7-day trends and a still-elevated VIX."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately constructive in the short term but only average when viewed over the week. Breadth is positive, with 11 assets up versus 4 down and no flat, and the average 1-day index change of roughly +0.60% shows a broad-based recovery rather than a narrow squeeze. However, the main U.S. equity benchmarks are still down over the last 7 days and the VIX, while down sharply today, is up more than 7% on the week and over 24% on the month, signaling lingering risk premia. A stable-to-softer 10Y yield over 7 and 30 days supports valuations, but the combination of higher medium-term volatility and only modest index drawdowns suggests a market that is healing from a wobble rather than fully healthy.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is clearly in large-cap growth and tech, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90% and QQQ up 0.88%, while the S&P 500 and SPY also post solid gains around 0.7%. On the downside, small caps are lagging, with the Russell 2000 slightly negative on the day (-0.05%) and Russell futures effectively flat (-0.01%). Over the week, the Dow 30 is a notable laggard at -1.12%, while the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq futures are down about 0.94–0.60%, underperforming the S&P 500's -0.47% and SPY's -0.39%, highlighting that recent weakness has been more pronounced in cyclicals and growth relative to the broader market.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "A key macro and geopolitical driver is the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's tariffs, which coincided with gains in U.S. and European equities and a rise in Treasury yields according to Channel NewsAsia. The removal of those tariffs is being interpreted as a potential positive for global trade and corporate margins, contributing to the risk-on tone visible in today's equity rebound and lower VIX. However, the same coverage notes that investors are also digesting a weak U.S. GDP print and higher-than-expected inflation, which tempers enthusiasm and helps explain why yields are higher on the day but lower over the week—a mixed backdrop that is supportive for selective risk-taking rather than a full-blown melt-up.",
      "Geopolitical tensions, particularly involving the Middle East and U.S.-Iran dynamics, are another important theme influencing the tape. News flow highlights that U.S.-Iran tensions have pressured global stocks at times and supported oil and gold, which is consistent with the strong 30-day moves in WTI crude (+18.7%) and gold (+14.2%). This combination of higher energy and safe-haven demand acts as a partial risk-off counterweight to today's equity strength, suggesting investors are hedging geopolitical tail risks even as they buy dips in U.S. stocks.",
      "Broader sentiment and cross-asset risk perception are also being shaped by lingering fear indicators despite recent rebounds. Coverage mentions that global markets have seen bouts of selling tied to AI-related concerns and that various "panic" or fear gauges are elevated, while crypto commentary notes "extreme fear" even as Bitcoin rises. This aligns with the VIX being significantly higher over 30 days (+24.1% to 19.09) and gold's strong rally, underscoring that the current bid in equities coexists with defensive positioning. The net effect is a choppy environment where macro and thematic worries encourage hedging, but supportive rulings on trade and lower medium-term yields allow for tactical risk-on flows."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete events over the next 24 hours mentioned in the provided data include continued digestion of the recent U.S. GDP and inflation reports referenced by Channel NewsAsia, which remain in focus for their implications on growth and policy. Investors are also watching ongoing developments around the Supreme Court's tariff ruling and its implementation, as follow-up political and corporate commentary could influence trade-sensitive sectors. Additionally, geopolitical headlines around U.S.-Iran tensions, noted in multiple global market recaps, could shift risk sentiment and energy prices intraday. Beyond these, specific scheduled earnings or central bank policy events are not detailed in the provided information.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — The most probable direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%, SPY +0.72%, QQQ +0.88%) and confirming strength in index futures (S&P Fut +0.67%, Nasdaq Fut +0.84%, Dow Fut +0.44%). The sharp 1-day drop in VIX (-5.6%) alongside stable-to-soft 10Y yields over the past week suggests that recent macro shocks are being absorbed rather than escalating. The Supreme Court's move to strike down Trump-era tariffs is a fresh, identifiable positive catalyst for risk assets, while weak GDP and firm inflation temper, but do not overwhelm, risk appetite. With breadth positive (11 up vs 4 down) and no clear new negative macro surprise in the next 24 hours identified in the data, the balance of evidence points to a continued, though likely moderate, upward bias.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Traders should monitor whether large-cap growth and tech leadership persists, particularly via the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, which are up 0.90% and 0.88% on the day. Sustained strength in Nasdaq futures (+0.84%) relative to S&P futures (+0.67%) would be consistent with the expected upward bias; any sharp reversal there would be an early warning of waning risk appetite. On the downside, watch the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which are flat to slightly negative; further underperformance from small caps would signal that the rally is increasingly narrow and vulnerable.",
      "On the macro front, focus on how the 10Y Treasury yield trades around the 4.1% area and whether the VIX remains near or below the 19 level. A renewed push higher in yields or a quick bounce in VIX back above recent levels would challenge the bullish near-term view and could cap further index gains. Energy and metals are also important tells: WTI crude, already up nearly 19% over 30 days, and gold, up over 14% in that span, are both sensitive to any escalation in geopolitical tensions or growth worries. If oil and gold continue to grind higher alongside equities, it would indicate persistent hedging and may argue for fading strength; if they stabilize or retrace while equities hold firm, it would support a cleaner risk-on extension.",
      "Finally, traders should track sector and asset responses to ongoing interpretation of the Supreme Court's decision on Trump tariffs, especially in trade-exposed and multinational-heavy indices like the S&P 500 and Dow. Continued resilience in SPY (+0.72% today) and Dow futures (+0.44%) would suggest markets are pricing in a durable improvement in the trade backdrop. Conversely, if newsflow around tariffs, GDP, or inflation sparks a narrative shift, expect that to show up first in higher-beta instruments (Nasdaq, Russell) and in a rebound in the VIX, which would argue for tightening risk and reassessing the short-term bullish bias."
