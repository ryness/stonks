  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with a clear positive inflection over the last day but modest damage over the past week. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day while still down 0.47% over 7 days, and the Nasdaq is up 0.90% on the day versus -0.94% over the week, showing a short-term tech-led rebound against a softer weekly trend. The Russell 2000 is marginally negative on the day (-0.05%) and down 0.60% over the week, indicating small caps are not fully participating in the bounce, which tempers the strength of risk appetite.
  
  Futures echo this constructive but not euphoric tone: S&P futures are up 0.67% and Nasdaq futures up 0.84% on the day, while both remain modestly lower over 7 days (-0.55% and -0.60% respectively), pointing to an improvement in near-term sentiment rather than a full trend reversal. At the same time, the VIX fell 5.64% on the day to 19.09, even though it is still up 7.31% over the week and 24.12% over 30 days, suggesting that risk appetite is improving tactically from recently elevated fear levels but remains more cautious than a month ago.
  
  In rates and cross-asset terms, the 10Y Treasury yield is essentially stable on the day (+0.27% to 4.09%) and lower over the week and month, which supports equity valuations without signaling a strong growth scare. Gold futures are up 1.68% on the day and 13.71% over 30 days, and WTI crude is up 18.57% over 30 days despite being flat on the day, reflecting persistent demand for hedges and real assets even as stocks rally. Overall, risk appetite is improving on today's tape, but elevated volatility versus 30 days ago and strong performance in gold indicate investors are still hedging and not fully embracing risk-on.
  
  unknown
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately positive on the day but only average over the recent trend. Breadth is constructive with 10 assets up versus 5 down and an average 1d index move of about +0.60%, indicating more widespread gains than losses. The VIX at 19.09 is down sharply on the day but remains materially higher than a month ago, showing that while immediate stress is easing, overall volatility is still elevated. The 10Y Treasury yield near 4.09% and drifting slightly lower over 7 and 30 days provides a supportive backdrop rather than a headwind, but the mixed weekly index performance suggests the market is in a fragile, not robust, equilibrium.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Nasdaq Composite is a clear leader with a +0.90% move, and QQQ similarly outperforms at +0.88%, while gold also rallies strongly at +1.68%. On the downside, the Russell 2000 is a laggard at -0.05% on the day, and Russell futures are effectively flat at -0.01%, underscoring small-cap underperformance. Over the week, the Dow 30 stands out negatively with a -1.12% move, while the Russell 2000 and gold show more resilience, with Russell up 3.43% and gold up 13.71% over 30 days, making them relative leaders on a longer horizon despite today's small-cap softness.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** One of the main macro drivers today is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down Trump's tariffs, which news reports link to gains in U.S. and European stocks and a rise in Treasury yields. This development appears to be risk-on for global equities, as the removal of unilateral tariffs is being interpreted as a positive for trade and corporate margins, aligning with today's broad index gains (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%) and higher equity futures. The accompanying uptick in yields and stronger stocks following the decision signals that investors see the ruling as growth-supportive rather than a deflationary shock. At the same time, the tape is absorbing weaker U.S. GDP and higher-than-expected inflation data, which have been noted alongside the tariff ruling in driving markets. This mix of softer growth and hotter inflation is typically risk-off, yet the equity advance and modest daily move in the 10Y yield (+0.27%) suggest investors are balancing macro concerns with relief from the tariff decision. The VIX's 5.64% decline today alongside a still-elevated 30-day gain of 24.12% indicates that while macro noise has recently lifted risk premia, today's catalysts are nudging positioning back toward risk-on without fully unwinding prior caution. Geopolitical tensions, particularly U.S.-Iran concerns and broader conflict risks referenced in futures commentary, continue to underpin demand for hedges and hard assets. This is reflected in gold futures gaining 1.68% on the day and 13.71% over 30 days, and WTI crude up 18.57% over 30 days, even as near-term equity sentiment improves. The combination of higher gold and oil with rising stocks shows that geopolitical risk is keeping a floor under defensive assets, muting the degree of risk-on and encouraging a barbell approach rather than an unhedged reach for beta.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours are referenced only generically in the news flow, such as continued digestion of recent U.S. GDP and inflation data and ongoing headlines around the Supreme Court tariff decision and U.S.-Iran tensions; specific scheduled earnings, data prints, or policy events for the next day are not identified in the provided data, so concrete catalysts beyond these themes are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, as major indices and futures are all showing synchronized daily gains (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%, S&P futures +0.67%, Nasdaq futures +0.84%) and the VIX is down 5.64% on the day, signaling improving risk appetite. The Supreme Court's decision to strike down tariffs is being interpreted as equity-positive in the news flow, and the 10Y yield is stable to slightly lower over the week and month, providing a supportive macro backdrop. However, the negative 7-day returns across most indices and still-elevated VIX versus 30 days ago argue against high conviction, keeping confidence at a moderate 60%.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the S&P 500 can build on its 0.69% daily gain and whether S&P futures, currently up 0.67% over the day, hold or extend those levels overnight, as sustained strength would validate the risk-on bias tied to the tariff ruling. Close attention to the Nasdaq Composite (+0.90% today) and Nasdaq futures (+0.84%) is important, since tech leadership has been key to the rebound while still sitting on 7-day and 30-day losses, and a reversal there would quickly undermine the constructive tone. Sector- and style-wise, the persistent underperformance of small caps, with the Russell 2000 down 0.05% on the day and negative on the week, should be monitored as a gauge of broader risk appetite beyond mega-cap tech. If small caps and Russell futures start to participate more meaningfully, it would confirm a healthier, more durable advance, whereas continued lagging would suggest the move is narrow and vulnerable. On the macro side, watch the VIX around the 19 handle and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.09%, as further downside in volatility alongside stable or gently lower yields would support another risk-on session. In parallel, the strong uptrend in gold (+13.71% over 30 days) and oil (+18.57% over 30 days) against improving equities should be monitored for any sharp spikes, which could signal a resurgence of geopolitical or macro stress that might cap or reverse the expected upward bias.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with a clear positive inflection over the last day but modest damage over the past week. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day while still down 0.47% over 7 days, and the Nasdaq is up 0.90% on the day versus -0.94% over the week, showing a short-term tech-led rebound against a softer weekly trend. The Russell 2000 is marginally negative on the day (-0.05%) and down 0.60% over the week, indicating small caps are not fully participating in the bounce, which tempers the strength of risk appetite.

Futures echo this constructive but not euphoric tone: S&P futures are up 0.67% and Nasdaq futures up 0.84% on the day, while both remain modestly lower over 7 days (-0.55% and -0.60% respectively), pointing to an improvement in near-term sentiment rather than a full trend reversal. At the same time, the VIX fell 5.64% on the day to 19.09, even though it is still up 7.31% over the week and 24.12% over 30 days, suggesting that risk appetite is improving tactically from recently elevated fear levels but remains more cautious than a month ago.

In rates and cross-asset terms, the 10Y Treasury yield is essentially stable on the day (+0.27% to 4.09%) and lower over the week and month, which supports equity valuations without signaling a strong growth scare. Gold futures are up 1.68% on the day and 13.71% over 30 days, and WTI crude is up 18.57% over 30 days despite being flat on the day, reflecting persistent demand for hedges and real assets even as stocks rally. Overall, risk appetite is improving on today's tape, but elevated volatility versus 30 days ago and strong performance in gold indicate investors are still hedging and not fully embracing risk-on.

unknown

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately positive on the day but only average over the recent trend. Breadth is constructive with 10 assets up versus 5 down and an average 1d index move of about +0.60%, indicating more widespread gains than losses. The VIX at 19.09 is down sharply on the day but remains materially higher than a month ago, showing that while immediate stress is easing, overall volatility is still elevated. The 10Y Treasury yield near 4.09% and drifting slightly lower over 7 and 30 days provides a supportive backdrop rather than a headwind, but the mixed weekly index performance suggests the market is in a fragile, not robust, equilibrium.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Nasdaq Composite is a clear leader with a +0.90% move, and QQQ similarly outperforms at +0.88%, while gold also rallies strongly at +1.68%. On the downside, the Russell 2000 is a laggard at -0.05% on the day, and Russell futures are effectively flat at -0.01%, underscoring small-cap underperformance. Over the week, the Dow 30 stands out negatively with a -1.12% move, while the Russell 2000 and gold show more resilience, with Russell up 3.43% and gold up 13.71% over 30 days, making them relative leaders on a longer horizon despite today's small-cap softness.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** One of the main macro drivers today is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down Trump's tariffs, which news reports link to gains in U.S. and European stocks and a rise in Treasury yields. This development appears to be risk-on for global equities, as the removal of unilateral tariffs is being interpreted as a positive for trade and corporate margins, aligning with today's broad index gains (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%) and higher equity futures. The accompanying uptick in yields and stronger stocks following the decision signals that investors see the ruling as growth-supportive rather than a deflationary shock. At the same time, the tape is absorbing weaker U.S. GDP and higher-than-expected inflation data, which have been noted alongside the tariff ruling in driving markets. This mix of softer growth and hotter inflation is typically risk-off, yet the equity advance and modest daily move in the 10Y yield (+0.27%) suggest investors are balancing macro concerns with relief from the tariff decision. The VIX's 5.64% decline today alongside a still-elevated 30-day gain of 24.12% indicates that while macro noise has recently lifted risk premia, today's catalysts are nudging positioning back toward risk-on without fully unwinding prior caution. Geopolitical tensions, particularly U.S.-Iran concerns and broader conflict risks referenced in futures commentary, continue to underpin demand for hedges and hard assets. This is reflected in gold futures gaining 1.68% on the day and 13.71% over 30 days, and WTI crude up 18.57% over 30 days, even as near-term equity sentiment improves. The combination of higher gold and oil with rising stocks shows that geopolitical risk is keeping a floor under defensive assets, muting the degree of risk-on and encouraging a barbell approach rather than an unhedged reach for beta.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours are referenced only generically in the news flow, such as continued digestion of recent U.S. GDP and inflation data and ongoing headlines around the Supreme Court tariff decision and U.S.-Iran tensions; specific scheduled earnings, data prints, or policy events for the next day are not identified in the provided data, so concrete catalysts beyond these themes are unknown.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, as major indices and futures are all showing synchronized daily gains (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%, S&P futures +0.67%, Nasdaq futures +0.84%) and the VIX is down 5.64% on the day, signaling improving risk appetite. The Supreme Court's decision to strike down tariffs is being interpreted as equity-positive in the news flow, and the 10Y yield is stable to slightly lower over the week and month, providing a supportive macro backdrop. However, the negative 7-day returns across most indices and still-elevated VIX versus 30 days ago argue against high conviction, keeping confidence at a moderate 60%.

3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the S&P 500 can build on its 0.69% daily gain and whether S&P futures, currently up 0.67% over the day, hold or extend those levels overnight, as sustained strength would validate the risk-on bias tied to the tariff ruling. Close attention to the Nasdaq Composite (+0.90% today) and Nasdaq futures (+0.84%) is important, since tech leadership has been key to the rebound while still sitting on 7-day and 30-day losses, and a reversal there would quickly undermine the constructive tone. Sector- and style-wise, the persistent underperformance of small caps, with the Russell 2000 down 0.05% on the day and negative on the week, should be monitored as a gauge of broader risk appetite beyond mega-cap tech. If small caps and Russell futures start to participate more meaningfully, it would confirm a healthier, more durable advance, whereas continued lagging would suggest the move is narrow and vulnerable. On the macro side, watch the VIX around the 19 handle and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.09%, as further downside in volatility alongside stable or gently lower yields would support another risk-on session. In parallel, the strong uptrend in gold (+13.71% over 30 days) and oil (+18.57% over 30 days) against improving equities should be monitored for any sharp spikes, which could signal a resurgence of geopolitical or macro stress that might cap or reverse the expected upward bias.
