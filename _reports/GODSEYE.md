  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a mixed and cautious tone with risk appetite fading on the week but stabilizing on the day: the S&P 500 fell 0.05% 1d and 0.91% 7d, the Dow dropped 0.65% 1d, while the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 eked out gains of 0.13% and 0.22% 1d, respectively. Futures mirror this hesitancy with ES -0.07% 1d, NQ essentially flat, YM -0.67%, and RTY +0.25% 1d.
  
  Volatility is easing on the day but remains elevated versus recent history, signaling constrained risk appetite: VIX is 19.83 (-0.85% 1d) but up 10.11% over 7d and 19.10% over 30d. Breadth is slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average index change is -0.05% 1d, reinforcing a cautious tape.
  
  Rates are a headwind to risk with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15, while the US Dollar ticked up 0.09% 1d. Commodities showed a cross-current with WTI +2.39% 1d and Gold -2.37% 1d, a mix that aligns with tighter financial conditions and a lukewarm risk backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mildly negative with breadth at 7 up versus 8 down and the average index change at -0.05% for the day, indicating only marginal net selling. Volatility is off slightly today (VIX -0.85% 1d) but remains elevated versus the past week and month, which keeps risk tolerance contained. The 10Y yield rising 0.88% to 4.15 adds pressure to equity multiples and supports the defensive tone. Overall, conditions look fragile but not disorderly.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted toward growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed with the Russell 2000 down 3.11% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.55%, whereas the Dow was relatively resilient at -0.35%. A notable positive standout today was QQQ at +0.08% 1d, and a notable negative standout was the Dow futures (YM) at -0.67% 1d.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** The dominant macro theme is fading hopes for a near-term Fed rate cut after hawkish commentary, which pressured equities and pushed U.S. Treasury yields higher, as reported by CNA. This has translated into a risk-off bias over the week (S&P 500 -0.91% 7d; Nasdaq -2.55% 7d) and a higher volatility backdrop over the month (VIX +19.10% 30d), with higher yields (10Y +0.70% 30d) tightening financial conditions. Global risk sentiment remains tentative after the worst U.S. equity day in about a month, with futures little changed and Asian markets reacting negatively per CNA updates. The day’s cross-asset moves—WTI crude up 2.39% alongside Gold down 2.37% and a slightly firmer Dollar (+0.09% 1d)—are consistent with a tighter policy narrative that skews near-term risk appetite to neutral-to-cautious.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% — Equities are mixed-to-soft with breadth slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and an average index decline of -0.05% 1d, futures are subdued to lower (ES -0.07%, YM -0.67%), volatility remains elevated on a 7d/30d basis, and the 10Y yield is rising (+0.88% 1d to 4.15) amid hawkish Fed narratives that weighed on the past week’s performance.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch the 10Y Treasury near 4.15 and the VIX around the 20 handle; further firming in yields or a VIX push above 20 would align with a downside bias and pressure equity multiples. In index futures, ES around 6,755 and NQ near 25,094 are key risk gauges for any drift lower, while YM’s relative weakness (last 47,229; -0.67% 1d) remains a tell for cyclicals. Track style and size leadership: the Russell 2000 at 2,388 (cash) and RTY futures at 2,396 bounced today but are still weak on the week (-3.11% and -3.13% 7d), so renewed rate back-up could reassert small-cap underperformance. Also monitor QQQ at 608.86 and the Nasdaq Composite at 22,900 for relative strength versus the Dow 30 at 47,147, and keep an eye on WTI near 60 and the US Dollar at 99.27 for additional risk-on/off signals.
