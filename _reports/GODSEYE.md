  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on in the very short term but still corrective over the past week and month. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day while down 0.47% over 7 days, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.90% on the day but down 0.94% over the week and 2.96% over 30 days. The Russell 2000 is marginally lower on the day (-0.05%) but still up 3.43% over 30 days, indicating small-cap strength on a longer horizon despite today's pause. This mix suggests risk appetite is improving today but has been fading over the past several weeks, especially in growth-heavy benchmarks.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm a tentative stabilisation in risk sentiment. The VIX fell 5.64% on the day to 19.09, though it remains elevated versus 30 days ago (+24.12%), implying that near-term anxiety is easing from higher levels. S&P and Nasdaq futures are higher on the day (+0.67% and +0.84%, respectively) but still down about 0.55–0.60% over 7 days and roughly 0.6–3.0% over 30 days, reinforcing a picture of a short-term bounce within a modest pullback phase.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed for risk appetite. The 10-year Treasury yield is nearly flat on the day (+0.27%) and slightly lower over 7 and 30 days (around -1.3% each), suggesting no acute new rates shock and a mildly supportive backdrop for equities. At the same time, classic risk hedges and cyclical indicators are firm: gold futures are up 2.11% on the day and 14.20% over 30 days, and WTI crude is up 18.74% over 30 days. Overall, risk appetite is modestly improving today versus recent days, but the elevated VIX versus a month ago and strong gold bid show that investors are still hedging and not fully embracing risk.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately constructive in the very near term, with breadth showing 11 assets up versus 4 down and an average 1-day index move of about +0.60%. Large-cap benchmarks (S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq) are all positive on the day, while the Russell 2000 is essentially flat, which is good but not exuberant breadth. The VIX's 5.64% drop today toward 19, alongside a stable-to-slightly-lower 10-year yield around 4.09%, indicates a less stressed volatility and rates backdrop than earlier in the month. Taken together, the market appears healthy enough for a rebound, but the still-elevated volatility versus 30 days ago and recent negative 7-day index returns imply an ongoing corrective environment rather than a fully robust uptrend.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is clearly in large-cap growth and tech proxies, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90% and QQQ up 0.88%, while SPY gains 0.72%. On the downside, small caps are lagging, with the Russell 2000 down 0.05% and Russell futures essentially flat (-0.01%) despite the broader rebound. Over the past week, all major U.S. equity benchmarks are slightly negative, but the Dow 30 is the notable laggard at -1.12% versus the S&P 500's -0.47% and Nasdaq's -0.94%, signaling relative underperformance in cyclicals and value-heavy blue chips.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A key macro and geopolitical driver is U.S. trade policy uncertainty and its partial resolution via the Supreme Court. One article notes that U.S. and European stocks rose and Treasury yields gained after the Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, while another highlights that these 'reciprocal tariffs' had previously been imposed under emergency powers and then overturned. The removal of blanket 10% tariff risk is a clear risk-on catalyst for globally exposed equities and supports the day's gains in the S&P 500 (+0.69%) and Nasdaq (+0.90%), while the modest rise in Treasury yields aligns with reduced safe-haven demand. At the same time, macro data are mixed and tempering risk appetite. The same coverage mentions a weak U.S. GDP report and higher-than-expected inflation data, which helps explain why the recent 7-day returns for major indices remain negative despite today's bounce (S&P 500 -0.47%, Nasdaq -0.94%). These data points keep growth concerns alive and justify the still-elevated VIX level versus a month ago (+24.12%) and the strong performance of gold over 30 days (+14.20%), both of which are consistent with a partial risk-off stance beneath the surface. Broader geopolitical and commodity dynamics are also in play. Separate global headlines reference U.S.-Iran tensions and related support for oil and gold, and this is consistent with the strong 30-day rally in WTI crude (+18.74%) and gold futures (+14.20%). These moves signal that investors remain attentive to geopolitical risk and are hedging via commodities, which can cap risk-on enthusiasm in equities even as specific positive catalysts like the tariff ruling spark short-term relief rallies.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete event timing for the next 24 hours is not specified in the provided data, but recent focus has been on U.S. GDP and inflation releases, as well as the Supreme Court's tariff decision and ongoing U.S.-Iran tensions. Upcoming corporate earnings are also cited generally as a driver in recent sessions. Markets are likely to remain sensitive to any follow-on policy commentary regarding tariffs, fresh macro prints related to growth and inflation, and headlines around Middle East tensions that could further influence oil and gold. Specific scheduled data points or company names for the next 24 hours are not given, so the exact calendar impact is unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up. Today's price action is broadly positive, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.90%, and futures higher across S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow (around +0.4–0.8%), while breadth shows 11 assets up vs. 4 down and average index gains near +0.60%. The VIX's 5.64% drop indicates easing near-term stress, and the Supreme Court's move to strike down tariffs has acted as a risk-on catalyst for U.S. and European equities. Offsetting this are weak recent 7-day returns and still-elevated volatility versus 30 days ago, which argue against a high-conviction, strong rally call, but overall the balance of evidence tilts toward a continued, though measured, upside bias.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch how index futures trade relative to cash closes, particularly S&P futures near 6,923.25 and Nasdaq futures around 25,067.50, to see if the current intraday strength sustains or fades overnight. A hold or extension of today's gains in SPY (+0.72%) and QQQ (+0.88%) would confirm follow-through on the tariff-driven risk-on tone; any sharp reversal that pushes futures back toward last week's reference levels (e.g., ES giving back roughly 0.5–0.7%) would signal the bounce is losing steam. Monitoring VIX around 19 is also critical: further compression from here would align with the projected modestly up tape, while a quick snap back higher would challenge that view. Sector and style leadership will matter, especially the relative performance of tech/growth versus cyclicals and small caps. The up bias assumes continued leadership from Nasdaq-linked vehicles (Nasdaq Composite +0.90%, QQQ +0.88%) and at least stabilization in laggards like the Dow 30 (+0.47% today but -1.12% over 7 days) and the Russell 2000 (-0.05% today). If small caps and Dow names start to catch up while gold (+14.20% over 30 days) and WTI crude (+18.74% over 30 days) pause or consolidate, it would confirm broadening risk-on sentiment; renewed outperformance of defensive trades (gold, elevated VIX) would argue for fading the upside. On the macro side, traders should stay alert to any additional headlines around the Supreme Court's tariff ruling and follow-up policy responses, as well as news on U.S.-Iran tensions that have been supporting oil and gold. These themes have recently moved both equities and rates, with the 10-year yield hovering near 4.09% after drifting lower over 7–30 days. Any fresh growth or inflation data surprises, even if not explicitly listed in the calendar, could quickly alter the current balance between risk assets and hedges, so monitoring how the 10-year yield trades around the recent 4.07–4.15% band will help validate or challenge the expected modestly higher equity path.

## 1. Pulse

Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on in the very short term but still corrective over the past week and month. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day while down 0.47% over 7 days, and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.90% on the day but down 0.94% over the week and 2.96% over 30 days. The Russell 2000 is marginally lower on the day (-0.05%) but still up 3.43% over 30 days, indicating small-cap strength on a longer horizon despite today's pause. This mix suggests risk appetite is improving today but has been fading over the past several weeks, especially in growth-heavy benchmarks.

Volatility and futures confirm a tentative stabilisation in risk sentiment. The VIX fell 5.64% on the day to 19.09, though it remains elevated versus 30 days ago (+24.12%), implying that near-term anxiety is easing from higher levels.
