  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a mixed, stabilizing tone on the day with the S&P 500 down 0.05%, the Dow 30 off 0.65%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while small caps (Russell 2000) gained 0.22%. Breadth was slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average index change was essentially flat at -0.05%, indicating cautious risk appetite with a mild tilt toward growth and small caps over blue chips.
  
  Volatility eased intraday but remains elevated in context: the VIX fell 0.85% to 19.83 today, yet it is up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over the past 30 days. This mix suggests risk appetite improved modestly today but is still fragile given the higher volatility regime versus recent weeks.
  
  Futures were similarly mixed: S&P futures -0.07%, Nasdaq futures essentially flat (0.00%), Dow futures -0.67%, and Russell futures +0.25%. Rates provided a headwind with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% to 4.15% on the day, and over the week equity futures are lower across the board (e.g., ES -1.03%, NQ -2.53%, RTY -3.13%), pointing to fading risk appetite over the weekly horizon.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral-to-fragile. Breadth was slightly negative at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners and the average index change was a marginal -0.05%, showing indecision. Volatility is still elevated with VIX at 19.83 and up 10.11% over the week, while the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% today to 4.15%, keeping financial conditions less supportive. Together, this suggests stabilization today but a cautious backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, small caps and growth showed relative strength with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the past week, small caps and tech underperformed the most with Russell futures -3.13% and Nasdaq futures -2.53%, whereas the Dow 30 was the relative leader at -0.35%. A clear 1d standout positive was Russell futures (+0.25%), and a negative standout was Dow futures (-0.67%).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Media coverage highlights a tech-led risk-off impulse and concerns about the Chinese economy, with reports noting global markets struggled after a tech sell-off and an unprecedented slump in investment in China. This aligns with the week’s underperformance in growth and small caps (Nasdaq Composite -2.55% and Russell 2000 -3.11% over 7d), reinforcing a risk-off tilt on a weekly basis despite today’s modest stabilization. US-focused coverage also emphasized a tech valuation reset and broader economic uncertainty, consistent with an elevated weekly VIX (+10.11%) and negative 7d returns across major US benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500 -0.91%). The combination of higher realized and implied risk and recent equity weakness leans risk-off at the margins, even as today’s VIX ticked down and select benchmarks eked out gains. On trade policy, Australia’s welcome of the removal of tariffs on beef and other food imports points to incremental easing in specific trade frictions, a modest risk-on signal for trade-exposed pockets. However, the impact appears secondary compared with the broader tech and China narratives given the week’s equity declines and lingering volatility.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% - Mixed signals dominate: S&P futures -0.07%, Nasdaq futures 0.00%, and breadth slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) with an average index move of -0.05%, while the VIX is lower on the day but elevated on a 7d basis (+10.11%) and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%. Tech and small caps stabilized today, but weekly momentum is still negative across major benchmarks, arguing for a balanced near-term path.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether volatility stays contained around the VIX 20 area and if S&P futures can hold near 6,755 while the cash S&P hovers around 6,734; sustained trade below these areas would increase downside risk. Keep an eye on the 10Y yield near 4.15% for clues to equity risk premia; further upticks would likely pressure cyclicals and high-duration growth. Monitor relative strength between growth and blue chips: Nasdaq futures around 25,094 versus Dow futures at 47,229 highlight the day’s divergence; continued weakness in the Dow alongside stability in tech would reinforce a rotation rather than a broad rally. Small caps near Russell futures 2,396 and the Russell 2000 at 2,388 need follow-through to shift the weekly downtrend. In commodities and FX, WTI near 60.09 and the US Dollar at 99.27 provide signals on global growth and financial conditions, while Gold’s 2.37% drop to 4,087.60 reflects the day’s firmer rates and dollar tone; sustained dollar firmness could cap risk appetite. A firming dollar and higher yields alongside an elevated but contained VIX would be consistent with a flat, range-bound session.

## 1. Pulse

Equities showed a mixed, stabilizing tone on the day with the S&P 500 down 0.05%, the Dow 30 off 0.65%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while small caps (Russell 2000) gained 0.22%. Breadth was slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average index change was essentially flat at -0.05%, indicating cautious risk appetite with a mild tilt toward growth and small caps over blue chips.

Volatility eased intraday but remains elevated in context: the VIX fell 0.85% to 19.83 today, yet it is up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over the past 30 days. This mix suggests risk appetite improved modestly today but is still fragile given the higher volatility regime versus recent weeks.

Futures were similarly mixed: S&P futures -0.07%, Nasdaq futures essentially flat (0.00%), Dow futures -0.67%, and Russell futures +0.25%. Rates provided a headwind with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% to 4.15% on the day, and over the week equity futures are lower across the board (e.g., ES -1.03%, NQ -2.53%, RTY -3.13%), pointing to fading risk appetite over the weekly horizon.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral-to-fragile. Breadth was slightly negative at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners and the average index change was a marginal -0.05%, showing indecision. Volatility is still elevated with VIX at 19.83 and up 10.11% over the week, while the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% today to 4.15%, keeping financial conditions less supportive. Together, this suggests stabilization today but a cautious backdrop.

1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, small caps and growth showed relative strength with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the past week, small caps and tech underperformed the most with Russell futures -3.13% and Nasdaq futures -2.53%, whereas the Dow 30 was the relative leader at -0.35%. A clear 1d standout positive was Russell futures (+0.25%), and a negative standout was Dow futures (-0.67%).

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Media coverage highlights a tech-led risk-off impulse and concerns about the Chinese economy, with reports noting global markets struggled after a tech sell-off and an unprecedented slump in investment in China. This aligns with the week’s underperformance in growth and small caps (Nasdaq Composite -2.55% and Russell 2000 -3.11% over 7d), reinforcing a risk-off tilt on a weekly basis despite today’s modest stabilization. US-focused coverage also emphasized a tech valuation reset and broader economic uncertainty, consistent with an elevated weekly VIX (+10.11%) and negative 7d returns across major US benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500 -0.91%). The combination of higher realized and implied risk and recent equity weakness leans risk-off at the margins, even as today’s VIX ticked down and select benchmarks eked out gains. On trade policy, Australia’s welcome of the removal of tariffs on beef and other food imports points to incremental easing in specific trade frictions, a modest risk-on signal for trade-exposed pockets. However, the impact appears secondary compared with the broader tech and China narratives given the week’s equity declines and lingering volatility.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% - Mixed signals dominate: S&P futures -0.07%, Nasdaq futures 0.00%, and breadth slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) with an average index move of -0.05%, while the VIX is lower on the day but elevated on a 7d basis (+10.11%) and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%. Tech and small caps stabilized today, but weekly momentum is still negative across major benchmarks, arguing for a balanced near-term path.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether volatility stays contained around the VIX 20 area and if S&P futures can hold near 6,755 while the cash S&P hovers around 6,734; sustained trade below these areas would increase downside risk. Keep an eye on the 10Y yield near 4.15% for clues to equity risk premia; further upticks would likely pressure cyclicals and high-duration growth. Monitor relative strength between growth and blue chips: Nasdaq futures around 25,094 versus Dow futures at 47,229 highlight the day’s divergence; continued weakness in the Dow alongside stability in tech would reinforce a rotation rather than a broad rally. Small caps near Russell futures 2,396 and the Russell 2000 at 2,388 need follow-through to shift the weekly downtrend. In commodities and FX, WTI near 60.09 and the US Dollar at 99.27 provide signals on global growth and financial conditions, while Gold’s 2.37% drop to 4,087.60 reflects the day’s firmer rates and dollar tone; sustained dollar firmness could cap risk appetite. A firming dollar and higher yields alongside an elevated but contained VIX would be consistent with a flat, range-bound session.
