  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are showing a mildly constructive tone with a defensive tilt. The S&P 500 and Dow are marginally lower on the day (-0.13% and -0.17%), but the Nasdaq Composite is flat to slightly positive (+0.01%) and small caps are stronger, with the Russell 2000 up +0.40%. Over the past week, all major indices are higher, led by the Russell 2000 (+1.83%) and Nasdaq (+1.57%), indicating that risk appetite is still improving on a multi-day basis despite today's mixed tape.","Volatility and futures point to a modest cooling of risk appetite near term. The VIX jumped +6.94% today to 16.48 even as it remains down -4.13% over the past week, suggesting some near-term hedging after a period of easing price pressures. S&P futures are off -0.12% on the day while Nasdaq futures are slightly positive (+0.05%) and Russell futures are up +0.23%, showing a small-cap and growth bias but with overall index gains capped.","Rates and cross-asset signals are slightly risk-unfriendly in the short run. The 10Y Treasury yield is up +0.94% on the day and about +4.5% over both 7 and 30 days, which tightens financial conditions at the margin. At the same time, gold is flat on the day (-0.04%) but up +2.26% over 30 days and crude is down -1.41% today and -3.69% over 30 days, a combination that points to lingering macro caution even as equity risk appetite has improved modestly over the week."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive but with signs of near-term strain. Breadth is slightly constructive with 8 instruments up versus 7 down, and the average 1-day index change is a small gain of about +0.04%, indicating a largely flat to gently risk-on session. However, the sharp 1-day rise in the VIX (+6.94% to 16.48) alongside a nearly 1% jump in the 10Y yield to 4.18 shows tightening conditions and an uptick in perceived risk. Overall, the market looks stable with improving weekly performance, but higher yields and volatility temper how "healthy" the tape feels today.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day and week leans toward small caps and growth, with the Russell 2000 a clear standout at +0.40% on the day and +1.83% over the week. On the large-cap side, SPY is also a leader on the day at +0.19%, and QQQ has led over the week with a +1.80% gain despite being marginally negative today (-0.03%). On the laggard side, the Dow 30 is underperforming with a -0.17% 1-day move, and Dow futures are even weaker at -0.26%, highlighting relative pressure on more traditional blue chips.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy expectations around inflation and central banks continue to underpin the tape. Recent news notes that stocks finished higher as price pressures eased, which helps explain the broadly positive 7-day moves in SPY (+1.58%), the S&P 500 (+0.71%), and the Nasdaq Composite (+1.57%), supporting a risk-on bias over the past week. At the same time, commentary that stocks are little changed with few catalysts ahead of an upcoming Fed decision suggests markets are consolidating gains as participants wait for clearer policy signals, consistent with today's small index moves and rise in VIX.","Energy and commodities reflect a more cautious growth tone, partially offset by geopolitical support. Crude is described as being supported recently by geopolitical tensions and economic optimism, yet today WTI crude is down -1.41% and -3.69% over 30 days, indicating that medium-term demand or supply concerns are outweighing recent optimism. Gold futures are slightly softer on the day (-0.04%) but up +2.26% over 30 days, consistent with investors maintaining some hedges amid geopolitical and macro uncertainty, which keeps risk appetite from becoming exuberant.","Crypto-related headlines underscore broader risk sentiment in speculative assets but are not clearly dictating equity direction. Stories on Bitcoin's sharp swings, downside risks in 2026, and mixed sentiment from high-profile crypto figures align with a more volatile, risk-sensitive backdrop, in line with the VIX sitting in the mid-teens and moving +6.94% today. These themes reinforce that while traditional equities are grinding higher on easing price pressures, investors remain selective and cautious in higher-beta corners of the market, tempering an otherwise risk-on bias."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key near-term triggers highlighted in the news flow revolve around central bank policy and inflation data, with several articles referencing an upcoming Federal Reserve decision and the importance of inflation readings like PCE for shaping rate expectations. Additionally, sector-specific events such as Micron's upcoming earnings, which Goldman Sachs has flagged due to AI-driven memory demand, and broader Big Tech developments (e.g., Amazon's Graviton5 CPU launch) could move technology indices like the Nasdaq and QQQ. Overall, policy signals on rates and any earnings surprises in key growth and AI-related names are the most likely events to shift market direction over the next 24 hours.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is flat, as the main equity benchmarks are showing only marginal 1-day changes (S&P 500 -0.13%, Dow -0.17%, Nasdaq Composite +0.01%) and S&P futures are off just -0.12%. Risk appetite has improved over the past week across indices, but today's notable VIX jump (+6.94%) and higher 10Y yield (+0.94% on the day) suggest increased caution that could cap further near-term upside. With news explicitly noting few fresh catalysts ahead of the next Fed decision and markets already pricing in easing price pressures, a consolidation day with limited index movement is more likely than a strong directional move up or down.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 can hold recent levels around 6,850–6,900 on cash and 6,870 on futures, as a break below these areas alongside elevated VIX could signal a shift from consolidation to a more defensive posture. The small-cap Russell complex, with the Russell 2000 up +0.40% and Russell futures +0.23% on the day, is a key tell for risk appetite; sustained strength there would be supportive of the flat-to-slightly-positive bias implied by the recent 7-day gains.","Sector-wise, tech and growth proxies like the Nasdaq Composite (+1.57% over 7 days) and QQQ (+1.80% over 7 days) should be monitored around any Big Tech or AI-related earnings and guidance, given their leadership role in the recent advance. On the macro side, watch the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.18% and the VIX around 16.5; a further rise in yields or volatility would argue for more defensive positioning, while stabilization or pullback in either could allow indices to continue their sideways grind. Movements in WTI crude, currently under pressure at -1.41% on the day, will also help gauge how much macro growth concern is bleeding into broader risk assets.","Overnight, cross-asset hedges such as gold and the US dollar bear watching for confirmation of the consolidation narrative. Gold's steady 30-day climb (+2.26%) and today's flat performance, alongside a largely unchanged dollar over 30 days (+0.16%), are consistent with a market that is neither panicking nor fully embracing risk; any abrupt move in these hedges could foreshadow a break from the expected flat equity trajectory. Traders should align intraday tactics with this base case of range-bound indices while being ready to react if incoming policy or inflation headlines deviate from the current benign expectations."]

["Equities are showing a mildly constructive tone with a defensive tilt. The S&P 500 and Dow are marginally lower on the day (-0.13% and -0.17%), but the Nasdaq Composite is flat to slightly positive (+0.01%) and small caps are stronger, with the Russell 2000 up +0.40%.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is flat, as the main equity benchmarks are showing only marginal 1-day changes (S&P 500 -0.13%, Dow -0.17%, Nasdaq Composite +0.01%) and S&P futures are off just -0.12%.

LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Equities are showing a mildly constructive tone with a defensive tilt. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow are marginally lower on the day (-0.13% and -0.17%), but the Nasdaq Composite is flat to slightly positive (+0.01%) and small caps are stronger, with the Russell 2000 up +0.40%. Over the past week, all major indices are higher, led by the Russell 2000 (+1.83%) and Nasdaq (+1.57%), indicating that risk appetite is still improving on a multi-day basis despite today’s mixed tape.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and futures point to a modest cooling of risk appetite near term.
