  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are showing a cautious risk-on tone in cash trading but a softer profile in futures. Major U.S. benchmarks were green on the last close, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.90%, and Dow 30 up 0.47%, while the Russell 2000 was marginally lower at -0.05%. ETFs echoed that strength (SPY +0.72%, QQQ +0.88%), indicating improving risk appetite on the day despite mixed small-cap participation.","Overnight and forward-looking, futures point to fading risk appetite. S&P futures are down 0.71%, Nasdaq futures -0.91%, Dow futures -0.60%, and Russell futures -1.02% over 1d, reversing much of the prior cash-session strength and signaling a risk-off lean into the next session. Volatility is easing tactically with VIX down 5.64% on the day to 19.09, but remains structurally higher over 7d and 30d (+7.31% and +24.12%), suggesting underlying unease. Rates are broadly stable-to-softer with the 10Y yield edging up just 0.27% on the day but down 1.47% over 7d and 1.26% over 30d, a backdrop consistent with late-cycle caution rather than aggressive risk-taking.","Cross-asset signals reinforce this defensive undercurrent despite the latest equity bounce. Gold futures are firmly higher (+2.40% 1d, +16.43% 30d), and WTI crude remains elevated on a 30d basis (+13.89%), while the U.S. dollar is softer on 1d and 30d horizons. Taken together, risk appetite improved in the last cash session but is fading again in futures, with defensive assets like gold and a persistently elevated VIX quantifying a more guarded stance."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately constructive in the short term but fragile under the surface. Breadth is almost evenly split with 7 instruments up and 8 down, yet the average 1d index change is a solid +0.60%, showing that gains in large benchmarks outweighed small-cap softness. The VIX's 5.64% drop on the day toward 19.09, alongside a relatively flat 10Y yield (4.09%, just +0.27% 1d and lower over 7d/30d), points to contained near-term stress but higher-than-month-ago risk premia. Overall, conditions look like a late-cycle grind higher, not a clean, broad, low-volatility advance.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in large-cap growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90% and QQQ up 0.88%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.69%. On the downside, small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 slipping -0.05% and Russell futures down -1.02%, making them the relative underperformers. Over the past week, however, all major U.S. equity benchmarks are slightly negative, with the Dow 30 (-1.12% 7d) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.94% 7d) notable laggards, while the Dow still holds a positive 30d gain of 1.29% versus a 2.96% 30d drop for the Nasdaq, underscoring more persistent pressure on high-growth tech.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical drivers are centered on trade policy shifts and growth/inflation concerns. A key catalyst has been the U.S. Supreme Court's decision striking down Trump-era tariffs, which coincided with gains in U.S. and European stocks and a rise in Treasury yields, a combination consistent with a risk-on reaction to reduced trade uncertainty. However, that same news flow also referenced a weak U.S. GDP report and higher-than-expected inflation, tempering enthusiasm by reinforcing a late-cycle, slower-growth, stickier-inflation backdrop that can cap multiple expansion.","Broader geopolitical and commodity themes are adding a defensive layer to the tape. Coverage points to tensions involving the United States and Iran as a factor keeping global markets on edge, supporting gold and oil, which aligns with the strong 30d gains in Gold futures (+16.43%) and WTI crude (+13.89%). At the same time, narratives around AI, rare earth supply chains, and military UAV spending highlight longer-term strategic competitions that can favor select sectors but generally contribute to a structurally higher risk premium, consistent with the VIX being up more than 24% over 30 days and strong flows into gold-related assets."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours are focused on macro data and ongoing digestion of the recent U.S. GDP and inflation surprises referenced in the tariff-ruling coverage, which markets are still parsing. Investors will also be sensitive to any incremental headlines on U.S.-Iran tensions, given prior reports that such tensions have weighed on global stocks and boosted safe havens like gold and oil. In addition, continued corporate earnings releases highlighted in recent news (e.g., healthcare, consumer, and commodity names) can drive sector-specific moves and influence overall sentiment if they alter the growth or margin narrative.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence – Cash equities just logged a solid up day (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%), but all major U.S. equity futures are currently lower over 1d (S&P -0.71%, Nasdaq -0.91%, Dow -0.60%, Russell -1.02%), suggesting a giveback of prior gains. Elevated but off-the-highs volatility (VIX 19.09, -5.64% 1d but +24.12% 30d), strong defensive demand for gold (+2.40% 1d, +16.43% 30d), and geopolitical tension around U.S.-Iran point to a risk-off bias overshadowing the recent tariff-relief rally. With weak GDP and higher-than-expected inflation still in focus, the balance of evidence tilts toward modest downside rather than further immediate upside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P futures can stabilize around current levels near 6,874 after their -0.71% 1d pullback, as a further break lower would confirm that the prior S&P 500 cash close at 6,909.51 was a short-lived relief rally. The Nasdaq futures level near 24,839.25 after a -0.91% 1d move is also important, given the recent leadership of tech; additional downside there would likely pressure QQQ (last 608.81, +0.88% 1d) and confirm renewed de-risking from growth.","Sector- and macro-wise, focus should remain on small caps and defensives alongside key macro prints and headlines tied to U.S. growth, inflation, and U.S.-Iran developments. The Russell complex is already under strain, with the Russell 2000 slightly negative on the day (-0.05%) and Russell futures off -1.02%, so further weakness there would signal deteriorating breadth. At the same time, continued strength in Gold futures (5,180.80, +2.40% 1d) and any renewed uptick in VIX from its current 19.09 level would validate a downside bias in risk assets and argue for tighter risk management into the next session."]

["Equities are showing a cautious risk-on tone in cash trading but a softer profile in futures. Major U.S. benchmarks were green on the last close, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.90%, and Dow 30 up 0.47%, while the Russell 2000 was marginally lower at -0.05%.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in large-cap growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90% and QQQ up 0.88%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.69%.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence – Cash equities just logged a solid up day (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%), but all major U.S. equity futures are currently lower over 1d (S&P -0.71%, Nasdaq -0.91%, Dow -0.60%, Russell -1.02%), suggesting a giveback of prior gains. Elevated but off-the-highs volatility (VIX 19.09, -5.64% 1d but +24.12% 30d), strong defensive demand for gold (+2.40% 1d, +16.43% 30d), and geopolitical tension around U.S.-Iran point to a risk-off bias overshadowing the recent tariff-relief rally.
