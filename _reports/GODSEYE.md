  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities closed with a constructive tone as all major U.S. benchmarks finished higher on the day, led by the Nasdaq Composite up 1.26% and QQQ up 1.45%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.81% and the Dow rose 0.63%. Small caps participated but lagged, with the Russell 2000 up 0.41%, and breadth modestly positive at 9 advances versus 6 declines across tracked assets, pointing to an improving but still selective risk appetite. Over the past week, tech-heavy gauges are leading, with the Nasdaq up 2.69% and QQQ up 2.45%, versus 1.61% for the S&P 500 and essentially flat for the Dow at -0.04%.","Volatility is easing tactically: the VIX fell 8.29% on the day and is down 12.96% over 7 days, even though it remains about 18.6% higher than 30 days ago, suggesting that the acute stress from recent selloffs and AI/trade fears is fading but not fully resolved. S&P and Nasdaq futures are slightly in the red overnight (ES -0.18%, NQ -0.29%), indicating consolidation rather than a sharp extension higher, while Russell and Dow futures are essentially flat to mildly negative, which tempers the strength of the intraday risk-on move.","Rates and cross-asset signals are supportive of a measured risk-on stance: the 10Y Treasury yield is nearly unchanged over 7 days (-0.20%) and lower by 3.32% over 30 days, while rising a modest 0.37% on the latest session to 4.05%. At the same time, traditional havens are strong on a longer horizon, with gold futures up 6.68% over 7 days and 13.51% over 30 days and crude up 5.20% and 7.23% over the same periods, indicating lingering macro and geopolitical caution even as near-term equity risk appetite improves. Overall, risk appetite is rebuilding in the short term, but the elevated 30-day VIX change and strong gold bid show it remains fragile."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately positive in the short term. Breadth is tilted to the upside with 9 assets up versus 6 down and the average 1d index move near 0.9%, led by the Nasdaq's 1.26% gain and a 0.81% rise in the S&P 500. Volatility is normalizing with the VIX down 8.29% on the day and nearly 13% over the week, while the 10Y Treasury yield is roughly flat over 7 days and lower over 30 days, reducing immediate rate pressure on equities. Taken together, this points to a market that has stabilized after recent stress but still carries residual caution, as reflected in an only modestly positive Dow on a weekly view and strong performance from gold.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is clearly in large-cap growth and tech: the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.26% and QQQ rose 1.45%, making them standout outperformers alongside the S&P 500 at +0.81%. On the downside, small caps and cyclicals lagged, with the Russell 2000 up only 0.41% and Dow futures currently softer than other futures at -0.22% overnight versus 7-day Dow cash performance of -0.04%. Over the week, the Nasdaq Composite (+2.69%) and QQQ (+2.45%) are the clear leaders, while the Dow 30 (-0.04% over 7d) is a relative laggard, underscoring ongoing rotation toward growth and away from more value/industrial-heavy benchmarks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical themes around trade policy and tariffs remain central drivers of recent volatility. News flow references renewed and potential future tariff threats from President Trump and the U.S. Supreme Court striking down prior tariffs, with markets reacting differently across indices as blue-chip, trade-sensitive names underperform while tech benchmarks rebound. This dynamic tends to inject headline risk and periodic risk-off episodes, but the latest session's gains in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 alongside lower VIX indicate that, for now, these trade concerns are being partially discounted, skewing the tape back toward risk-on.","Concerns about AI-related disruption have also been a notable macro narrative, with prior reports pointing to selloffs in IT and AI-exposed sectors and references to fears over AI's impact on jobs and corporate business models. Those AI-driven worries helped fuel earlier volatility and sector rotation, but the current strong performance in QQQ (+1.45% 1d, +2.45% 7d) and the Nasdaq Composite (+1.26% 1d, +2.69% 7d) suggests markets are shifting back toward embracing AI-linked growth themes after an initial risk-off repricing. At the same time, the continued strength in gold (up 6.68% over 7 days and 13.51% over 30 days) and firmness in crude oil prices reflect an undercurrent of macro and geopolitical caution—linked in the headlines to Middle East tensions and broader recession or policy risks—that caps how far risk-on sentiment can extend."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Near-term, markets are poised to react to U.S. macro commentary and data and to political events such as President Trump's State of the Union address and related tariff rhetoric, which recent futures commentary flags as key for S&P 500 index futures. Investors are also watching upcoming U.S. economic releases highlighted in futures recap pieces, including GDP and inflation data like PCE, as prior GDP misses and inflation surprises have moved S&P futures and rates. In addition, global developments tied to U.S.-Iran tensions and central bank decisions such as China's loan prime rate, referenced in Asia-Pacific market previews, could influence risk appetite via moves in crude, gold, and global equities over the next 24 hours.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The balance of evidence tilts modestly higher for the next 24 hours: U.S. equities just logged broad, tech-led gains (Nasdaq +1.26%, S&P 500 +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.41%) with positive breadth (9 up vs 6 down) and a sharply lower VIX (-8.29% 1d, -12.96% 7d), indicating improving risk appetite. Futures are slightly negative to flat (ES -0.18%, NQ -0.29%, RTY -0.05%), suggesting consolidation rather than a reversal, so any incremental positive surprise from upcoming macro or political events could extend the rebound. However, strong gold and oil over the past week and month plus elevated VIX versus 30 days ago highlight persistent macro and geopolitical risks, keeping confidence in a further advance only moderate rather than high.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should monitor how U.S. index futures trade around recent cash closes, particularly S&P 500 futures near 6,950 and Nasdaq futures around 25,300, as holding these areas would confirm that the latest equity rebound is being respected overnight. Sector-wise, tech and large-cap growth leadership is central: sustained strength in QQQ and the Nasdaq Composite after their 1.45% and 1.26% daily gains would be consistent with the projected upward bias, while any abrupt underperformance there relative to the S&P 500 would be an early warning that the rally is stalling.","On the macro side, attention should stay on U.S. political and tariff headlines around President Trump's public appearances and State of the Union messaging, since prior tariff threats and legal rulings have driven sharp cross-asset moves. Watch the 10Y Treasury yield around the 4.0%–4.1% area and the VIX near its current 17.9 level: a renewed spike in yields or volatility would challenge the risk-on setup, whereas stable or lower yields and further VIX compression would support additional upside in equities, even as strong gold and firm crude prices continue to flag underlying macro tension."]

### Latest news (0-3 days)

## 1. Pulse

["Equities closed with a constructive tone as all major U.S. benchmarks finished higher on the day, led by the Nasdaq Composite up 1.26% and QQQ up 1.45%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.81% and the Dow rose 0.63%. Small caps participated but lagged, with the Russell 2000 up 0.41%, and breadth modestly positive at 9 advances versus 6 declines across tracked assets, pointing to an improving but still selective risk appetite. Over the past week, tech-heavy gauges are leading, with the Nasdaq up 2.69% and QQQ up 2.45%, versus 1.61% for the S&P 500 and essentially flat for the Dow at -0.04%.","Volatility is easing tactically: the VIX fell 8.29% on the day and is down 12.96% over 7 days, even though it remains about 18.6% higher than 30 days ago, suggesting that the acute stress from recent selloffs and AI/trade fears is fading but not fully resolved. S&P and Nasdaq futures are slightly in the red overnight (ES -0.18%, NQ -0.29%), indicating consolidation rather than a sharp extension higher, while Russell and Dow futures are essentially flat to mildly negative, which tempers the strength of the intraday risk-on move.","Rates and cross-asset signals are supportive of a measured risk-on stance: the 10Y Treasury yield is nearly unchanged over 7 days (-0.20%) and lower by 3.32% over 30 days, while rising a modest 0.37% on the latest session to 4.05%. At the same time, traditional havens are strong on a longer horizon, with gold futures up 6.68% over 7 days and 13.51% over 30 days and crude up 5.20% and 7.23% over the same periods, indicating lingering macro and geopolitical caution even as near-term equity risk appetite improves. Overall, risk appetite is rebuilding in the short term, but the elevated 30-day VIX change and strong gold bid show it remains fragile."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately positive in the short term. Breadth is tilted to the upside with 9 assets up versus 6 down and the average 1d index move near 0.9%, led by the Nasdaq's 1.26% gain and a 0.81% rise in the S&P 500. Volatility is normalizing with the VIX down 8.29% on the day and nearly 13% over the week, while the 10Y Treasury yield is roughly flat over 7 days and lower over 30 days, reducing immediate rate pressure on equities. Taken together, this points to a market that has stabilized after recent stress but still carries residual caution, as reflected in an only modestly positive Dow on a weekly view and strong performance from gold.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is clearly in large-cap growth and tech: the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.26% and QQQ rose 1.45%, making them standout outperformers alongside the S&P 500 at +0.81%. On the downside, small caps and cyclicals lagged, with the Russell 2000 up only 0.41% and Dow futures currently softer than other futures at -0.22% overnight versus 7-day Dow cash performance of -0.04%. Over the week, the Nasdaq Composite (+2.69%) and QQQ (+2.45%) are the clear leaders, while the Dow 30 (-0.04% over 7d) is a relative laggard, underscoring ongoing rotation toward growth and away from more value/industrial-heavy benchmarks.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical themes around trade policy and tariffs remain central drivers of recent volatility. News flow references renewed and potential future tariff threats from President Trump and the U.S. Supreme Court striking down prior tariffs, with markets reacting differently across indices as blue-chip, trade-sensitive names underperform while tech benchmarks rebound. This dynamic tends to inject headline risk and periodic risk-off episodes, but the latest session's gains in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 alongside lower VIX indicate that, for now, these trade concerns are being partially discounted, skewing the tape back toward risk-on.","Concerns about AI-related disruption have also been a notable macro narrative, with prior reports pointing to selloffs in IT and AI-exposed sectors and references to fears over AI's impact on jobs and corporate business models. Those AI-driven worries helped fuel earlier volatility and sector rotation, but the current strong performance in QQQ (+1.45% 1d, +2.45% 7d) and the Nasdaq Composite (+1.26% 1d, +2.69% 7d) suggests markets are shifting back toward embracing AI-linked growth themes after an initial risk-off repricing. At the same time, the continued strength in gold (up 6.68% over 7 days and 13.51% over 30 days) and firmness in crude oil prices reflect an undercurrent of macro and geopolitical caution—linked in the headlines to Middle East tensions and broader recession or policy risks—that caps how far risk-on sentiment can extend."

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Near-term, markets are poised to react to U.S. macro commentary and data and to political events such as President Trump's State of the Union address and related tariff rhetoric, which recent futures commentary flags as key for S&P 500 index futures. Investors are also watching upcoming U.S. economic releases highlighted in futures recap pieces, including GDP and inflation data like PCE, as prior GDP misses and inflation surprises have moved S&P futures and rates. In addition, global developments tied to U.S.-Iran tensions and central bank decisions such as China's loan prime rate, referenced in Asia-Pacific market previews, could influence risk appetite via moves in crude, gold, and global equities over the next 24 hours.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The balance of evidence tilts modestly higher for the next 24 hours: U.S. equities just logged broad, tech-led gains (Nasdaq +1.26%, S&P 500 +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.41%) with positive breadth (9 up vs 6 down) and a sharply lower VIX (-8.29% 1d, -12.96% 7d), indicating improving risk appetite. Futures are slightly negative to flat (ES -0.18%, NQ -0.29%, RTY -0.05%), suggesting consolidation rather than a reversal, so any incremental positive surprise from upcoming macro or political events could extend the rebound. However, strong gold and oil over the past week and month plus elevated VIX versus 30 days ago highlight persistent macro and geopolitical risks, keeping confidence in a further advance only moderate rather than high.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should monitor how U.S. index futures trade around recent cash closes, particularly S&P 500 futures near 6,950 and Nasdaq futures around 25,300, as holding these areas would confirm that the latest equity rebound is being respected overnight. Sector-wise, tech and large-cap growth leadership is central: sustained strength in QQQ and the Nasdaq Composite after their 1.45% and 1.26% daily gains would be consistent with the projected upward bias, while any abrupt underperformance there relative to the S&P 500 would be an early warning that the rally is stalling.","On the macro side, attention should stay on U.S. political and tariff headlines around President Trump's public appearances and State of the Union messaging, since prior tariff threats and legal rulings have driven sharp cross-asset moves. Watch the 10Y Treasury yield around the 4.0%–4.1% area and the VIX near its current 17.9 level: a renewed spike in yields or volatility would challenge the risk-on setup, whereas stable or lower yields and further VIX compression would support additional upside in equities, even as strong gold and firm crude prices continue to flag underlying macro tension."]
