  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities the tone is firmly risk-on, with all major US indices higher on the day and small caps leading: the Russell 2000 gained 1.58%, the Dow 30 rose 1.23%, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.69%, and the S&P 500 was up 0.64%. Over the past week, performance is more mixed, with the Dow up 1.10% while the S&P 500 is essentially flat (-0.11%) and the Nasdaq is down 0.70%, suggesting today's strength is rebuilding risk appetite after a modest tech-led pause.
  
  Futures echo the positive equity tone, with S&P futures up 0.68%, Nasdaq futures up 0.82%, Dow futures up 1.32%, and Russell futures up 1.57% on the day, while 7d changes remain modestly negative for the S&P and Nasdaq and slightly positive for the Dow and Russell. This pattern points to improving near-term risk appetite concentrated in cyclicals and small caps, with an average 1d index move of about +0.93% and breadth showing 13 assets up versus only 2 down.
  
  Volatility and rates are supportive of risk but flashing a mild caution signal: the VIX is low at 14.90 and still 37% below its 30d level, but it rose 2.69% on the day and 6.43% over the week, indicating investors are paying a bit more for downside protection even as stocks rally. The 10Y Treasury yield edged down 0.53% on the day to 4.16% and is roughly flat over 7d, which alongside a slightly softer dollar (-0.05% on the day, -1.86% over 30d) facilitates the risk-on move without signaling a strong shift in growth or Fed expectations.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly constructive in the short term. Breadth is strong with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1d index gain near 0.93% indicates broad participation across benchmarks rather than a narrow, mega-cap-driven move. Volatility remains subdued with the VIX under 15 and down 37% over 30 days, even though it ticked higher today, suggesting overall stress is low. A stable-to-slightly-lower 10Y yield around 4.16% provides a benign rates backdrop, supporting the view of a healthy, risk-accommodating tape.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.58% and Dow futures up 1.32%, while the cash Dow gained 1.23%. On the downside, there are no major equity benchmarks in the red today, but laggards on a relative basis include the S&P 500 at +0.64% and the Nasdaq Composite at +0.69%, as well as SPY at +0.67%. Over the past week, the Dow 30 stands out positively with a 1.10% gain, whereas the Nasdaq Composite (-0.70%) and QQQ ETF (-0.66%) are notable underperformers, highlighting a mild rotation away from recently leading tech.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A key macro-geopolitical driver is the US military strike in Venezuela and the capture/arrest of President Maduro, which is directly affecting energy and related risk sentiment. News indicates US oil majors are jumping and WTI crude is up 1.26% on the day, while Venezuelan-linked assets are rallying, reflecting expectations of supply and regime-change implications. This has contributed to a risk-on tone in US equities, particularly in the Dow where energy and industrials have heavier weights, helping to push it up 1.23% and to a record high according to linked market coverage. Another important theme is the ongoing AI and tech narrative, with reports that hopes for AI demand are buoying techs as Wall Street reassesses growth leaders into 2026. This is visible in the Nasdaq Composite's 0.69% gain and QQQ's 0.79% rise on the day, despite both being slightly negative over the past week, suggesting AI optimism is helping revive risk appetite after a brief consolidation. The supportive macro backdrop of strong 2025 gains powered by the AI trade, as noted in recent year-end summaries, keeps investors in a generally risk-on posture even as they start to price in more event risk ahead. Looking slightly beyond today, markets are also oriented around upcoming macro policy and legal decisions that inform Fed and trade policy paths. Coverage highlights that January 9th US jobs data is seen as a key signal for the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate move, and investors are also watching forthcoming Supreme Court decisions on tariffs and the selection of a new Fed chair. While these are not impacting today's tape directly, awareness of these catalysts explains the slight uptick in VIX over the past week (+6.43%) and keeps a modest risk-off hedge in place alongside otherwise strong equity performance.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the main identified macro trigger is positioning ahead of the January 9th US jobs report, which markets view as pivotal for signaling the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate move and could influence both yields and equity valuations. Traders will also be sensitive to any additional headlines or clarifications around the US military action in Venezuela, including its impact on oil supply and sanctions, as these can shift energy prices and broader risk sentiment. No specific earnings releases or Fed speeches are detailed in the provided data for the next day, so macro data anticipation and geopolitical updates are likely to be the primary near-term drivers.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The balance of evidence points to a modestly higher market in the next 24 hours. All major equity indices and futures are up around 0.6–1.6% today, breadth is strong (13 up vs. 2 down), and the VIX, while up slightly on the day, remains low and far below its 30-day level, indicating contained fear. The 10Y yield is marginally lower and stable on a weekly basis, and the main upcoming macro catalyst (jobs data on January 9th) is still a few days away, suggesting today's risk-on tone led by the Dow and Russell has room to carry into the next session barring unforeseen shocks.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and its futures can build on the roughly +0.64–0.68% daily move and hold recent highs around current levels near 6,900–6,950. Follow-through in small caps and cyclicals will be important, with the Russell 2000 and Russell futures already up about 1.6% on the day and leading over the past month (+8.5–8.8%); sustained strength there would confirm improving risk appetite beneath the surface. Tech benchmarks like the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, slightly weaker on a 7-day basis, should be monitored for continued AI-driven stabilization versus renewed underperformance. On the macro side, focus should remain on the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.16% and the VIX around 15: continued stability or mild drift lower in yields alongside a subdued VIX would validate the constructive, risk-on bias, while any sharp spike in either would challenge the upside case. In commodities, watch WTI crude around $58 and gold near $4,446, as both are elevated today—sustained oil strength tied to Venezuela headlines would keep energy leadership intact, while further gold gains could hint at rising hedging demand. Positioning ahead of the January 9th jobs report will also start to matter more; any data or commentary that shifts expectations for Fed policy could quickly feed through rates into index futures overnight.

## 1. Pulse

Across equities the tone is firmly risk-on, with all major US indices higher on the day and small caps leading: the Russell 2000 gained 1.58%, the Dow 30 rose 1.23%, the Nasdaq Composite added 0.69%, and the S&P 500 was up 0.64%. Over the past week, performance is more mixed, with the Dow up 1.10% while the S&P 500 is essentially flat (-0.11%) and the Nasdaq is down 0.70%, suggesting today's strength is rebuilding risk appetite after a modest tech-led pause.

Futures echo the positive equity tone, with S&P futures up 0.68%, Nasdaq futures up 0.82%, Dow futures up 1.32%, and Russell futures up 1.57% on the day, while 7d changes remain modestly negative for the S&P and Nasdaq and slightly positive for the Dow and Russell. This pattern points to improving near-term risk appetite concentrated in cyclicals and small caps, with an average 1d index move of about +0.93% and breadth showing 13 assets up versus only 2 down.

Volatility and rates are supportive of risk but flashing a mild caution signal: the VIX is low at 14.90 and still 37% below its 30d level, but it rose 2.69% on the day and 6.43% over the week, indicating investors are paying a bit more for downside protection even as stocks rally. The 10Y Treasury yield edged down 0.53% on the day to 4.16% and is roughly flat over 7d, which alongside a slightly softer dollar (-0.05% on the day, -1.86% over 30d) facilitates the risk-on move without signaling a strong shift in growth or Fed expectations.

Volatility remains subdued with the VIX under 15 and down 37% over 30 days, even though it ticked higher today, suggesting overall stress is low. A stable-to-slightly-lower 10Y yield around 4.16% provides a benign rates backdrop, supporting the view of a healthy, risk-accommodating tape.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.58% and Dow futures up 1.32%, while the cash Dow gained 1.23%. On the downside, there are no major equity benchmarks in the red today, but laggards on a relative basis include the S&P 500 at +0.64% and the Nasdaq Composite at +0.69%, as well as SPY at +0.67%. Over the past week, the Dow 30 stands out positively with a 1.10% gain, whereas the Nasdaq Composite (-0.70%) and QQQ ETF (-0.66%) are notable underperformers, highlighting a mild rotation away from recently leading tech.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The balance of evidence points to a modestly higher market in the next 24 hours. All major equity indices and futures are up around 0.6–1.6% today, breadth is strong (13 up vs. 2 down), and the VIX, while up slightly on the day, remains low and far below its 30-day level, indicating contained fear.

3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and its futures can build on the roughly +0.64–0.68% daily move and hold recent highs around current levels near 6,900–6,950. Follow-through in small caps and cyclicals will be important, with the Russell 2000 and Russell futures already up about 1.6% on the day and leading over the past month (+8.5–8.8%); sustained strength there would confirm improving risk appetite beneath the surface. Tech benchmarks like the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, slightly weaker on a 7-day basis, should be monitored for continued AI-driven stabilization versus renewed underperformance. On the macro side, focus should remain on the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.16% and the VIX around 15: continued stability or mild drift lower in yields alongside a subdued VIX would validate the constructive, risk-on bias, while any sharp spike in either would challenge the upside case. In commodities, watch WTI crude around $58 and gold near $4,446, as both are elevated today—sustained oil strength tied to Venezuela headlines would keep energy leadership intact, while further gold gains could hint at rising hedging demand.
