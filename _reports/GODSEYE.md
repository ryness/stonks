  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equity tone is constructive, with all major US indices higher on the day and week. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day and 2.10% over 7d, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.82% 1d and 2.23% 7d, and the Dow 30 has gained 0.67% 1d and 1.80% 7d. Small caps are particularly strong near term, with the Russell 2000 up 0.82% on the day and 6.18% over the week despite being down 1.33% over 30d, signaling a rebound in risk appetite toward higher-beta exposures.
  
  Volatility is trending lower alongside the equity grind higher, reinforcing a risk-on tone. The VIX is down 0.52% on the day and has collapsed about 31% over 7d and 32% over 30d to 17.10, indicating a sharp reset in hedging demand and perceived tail risk. At the same time, the 10Y Treasury yield is modestly lower (about -3.27% over 7d to ~4.00%), suggesting easing rate worries are underpinning the equity bid rather than a disorderly growth scare.
  
  Equity futures extend the positive tone, pointing to ongoing strength into the next session. S&P futures are up 1.57% on the day, Nasdaq futures 1.44%, Dow futures 2.06%, and Russell futures 2.91%, all outperforming their respective cash benchmarks and indicating incremental demand after the cash close. Taken together with broad advances in 12 of 15 tracked assets and an average index gain of about 0.76% on the day, risk appetite is clearly improving rather than fading.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid to strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive, with 12 assets up and only 3 down, and the average index move of roughly +0.76% 1d shows gains are broad-based rather than narrowly led. Volatility is compressing sharply, with VIX down about 31% over the week to 17.10, while the 10Y Treasury yield has drifted lower to around 4.00%, indicating easing rate pressure. This combination of rising equities, broad participation, and calmer rates/vol points to a healthy, risk-on environment for now.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from small caps and cyclicals, with Russell 2000 futures up 2.91% and Dow futures up 2.06%, while the cash Russell 2000 is up 0.82%. On the growth side, tech-heavy benchmarks are also strong, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.82% and QQQ up 0.88% on the day. On the downside, energy is the primary laggard, with WTI crude down 0.19% 1d, and the US Dollar is only marginally higher (+0.08%), underperforming the equity complex despite the broader risk-on move.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro drivers remain centered on shifting Federal Reserve expectations and a relief rally after prior weakness. Multiple headlines reference a "Fed-fueled rebound" and growing hopes for a December rate cut, while the 10Y yield has fallen about 3.27% over the week to near 4.00%. This decline in yields is consistent with the sharp drop in VIX and broad equity gains, signaling a clear risk-on impulse as investors price a softer policy path. AI and megacap tech optimism are also key catalysts supporting the tape. News flow points to an Alphabet-led AI rally fueling a tech comeback, with articles highlighting Nasdaq outperformance and tech-led surges ahead of the Thanksgiving week. This aligns with the Nasdaq Composite’s 1d gain of 0.82% and 7d gain of 2.23%, and QQQ’s 0.88% 1d rise, reinforcing a risk-on tilt toward growth and AI beneficiaries. Global risk sentiment is being buoyed by international equity strength and lower crude, which together reduce macro stress. Coverage of a large rally in Indian benchmarks driven by Fed cut hopes, easing foreign outflows, and declining crude prices echoes the US pattern of rate relief and softer oil; WTI is down 2.26% over 7d and nearly flat over 30d. This mix of stronger global equities and benign commodity pricing is supportive of continued risk-taking across US indices.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the main triggers are macro and calendar-related rather than single-name events. Several reports flag a potentially volatile, holiday-shortened week with a "string of economic data" and delayed inflation releases, so any incoming inflation and consumer data prints could move rates and equities as traders refine Fed cut expectations. Trading hours around Thanksgiving and the early close on Black Friday, highlighted in multiple articles, can also amplify moves due to thinner liquidity. Additionally, ongoing Fed commentary and further coverage of rate-cut odds, as referenced in Fed-focused stories, may influence yields and equity futures if rhetoric shifts more hawkish or dovish.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is higher. All major US equity benchmarks are already in short-term uptrends (S&P 500 +0.69% 1d and +2.10% 7d, Nasdaq +0.82% 1d and +2.23% 7d, Russell 2000 +0.82% 1d and +6.18% 7d), VIX is down about 31% over the week, and breadth is strong with 12 of 15 assets higher. Equity futures are outperforming cash (S&P futures +1.57%, Dow futures +2.06%, Russell futures +2.91% on the day), while news flow emphasizes Fed cut hopes and an ongoing pre-Thanksgiving rebound, all of which skew the near-term bias modestly to the upside despite holiday-thinned liquidity.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether equity futures can hold their gains into the next session, particularly S&P futures around the recent 6,826.75 close and Nasdaq futures near 25,306.75. Continued strength in small caps will be an important tell for risk appetite; Russell futures are up 2.91% on the day and 3.89% over the week even though the 30d change remains slightly negative, so a sustained push above the 2,489 area would reinforce the risk-on message. Monitoring VIX around the 17 handle will also be key, as further compression from the recent -30.7% 7d move would confirm a stable backdrop for an upward grind. Sector-wise, tech and cyclicals should remain in focus given the AI- and Fed-driven narrative and outperformance of the Nasdaq and Dow. Any fresh Fed commentary or inflation/consumer data discussed in the macro coverage could impact the 10Y yield near 4.00%; a continued drift lower in yields would support the call for further equity upside. Additionally, keep an eye on WTI crude around $58–59 and gold near 4,189, as their recent moves (oil softer over 7d, gold up 2.48% 7d) provide a read on growth versus safety positioning that could either validate or challenge the current risk-on tone.
