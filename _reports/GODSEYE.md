  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is clearly risk-on with all major U.S. benchmarks up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–4.2% over the past week, while small caps in the Russell 2000 have surged 6.5% over 7 days. ETFs mirror this strength, with SPY up 0.55% and QQQ up 0.81% on the day, indicating broad participation with a growth tilt and improving risk appetite. The average 1d index gain of about 0.62% and 12 up vs 3 down in the breadth snapshot confirm a constructive tape.
  
  Volatility and rates are reinforcing this supportive backdrop. The VIX is down 4.9% on the day and almost 34% over the week to 16.35, signaling a sharp compression in hedging demand as equity indices rally. The 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day at 4.02% (+0.48% 1d) but has eased 2.6% over the week, suggesting rate pressure has not been an impediment to equities and is moderately supportive of risk.
  
  Futures pricing is even more bullish than spot, highlighting strong near-term risk appetite. S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are all up roughly 2.1–2.6% on the day, and Russell futures stand out with a 3.6% 1d jump and 4.6% gain over the week, despite being flat over 30 days. This combination of strong equity and futures gains, falling volatility, and stable-to-softer yields indicates risk appetite is improving meaningfully rather than fading, with multi-asset confirmation from gold’s 3.1% 1d rise and a slightly softer dollar.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health screens as strong based on the benchmark changes. The average 1d index move is about +0.62%, and breadth shows 12 instruments up versus only 3 down, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow mega-cap rally. Volatility has compressed sharply, with the VIX down nearly 34% over the week to 16.35, while the 10Y yield is modestly lower over 7 days, reducing rate headwinds. Taken together, the mix of positive breadth, moderate index gains, and a calmer volatility and Treasury backdrop suggests a relatively healthy risk environment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and cyclicals via QQQ (+0.81%) and the Russell 2000 (+0.58% cash, +3.57% on Russell futures), with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.65%. On a weekly basis, small caps are clear standouts, with the Russell 2000 up 6.46% versus 3.5–4.2% for the large-cap indices. On the downside, the main laggards are in commodities: WTI crude is off 0.49% on the day and down 2.56% over the week, while the U.S. dollar is slightly weaker on the day (-0.14%) and week (-0.09%), underscoring that leadership is centered in equities rather than in defensives or energy.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and trading-structure factors around the U.S. holiday period are influencing today’s tape. U.S. markets operated on an early Black Friday close, and a CME Group outage tied to a data centre cooling failure temporarily halted futures trading, which can distort intraday liquidity and price discovery. Despite that disruption, the end-state was constructive, with U.S. stock futures and cash indices closing solidly in the green, indicating that the outage was a transient operational issue rather than a risk-off macro shock. Rate expectations and associated policy narratives are also in the backdrop, supporting a risk-on tone. Recent coverage notes that Fed commentary and weak data have boosted global rate-cut hopes, and the U.S. 10Y yield has drifted about 2.6% lower over the week even as equities climbed 3.5–4.2%, which is a classic risk-supportive combination. The concurrent drop in the VIX by roughly a third over the week suggests investors are growing more comfortable with the macro path, treating softer yields and dovish-leaning signals as catalysts for adding equity and growth exposure. Sector and cross-asset flows hint at a blend of risk-on positioning and some hedging via hard assets. Pre-market commentary highlighted strong gains in U.S. futures and specific growth names, while gold futures jumped 3.1% on the day and over 3.2% on the week, pointing to persistent demand for protection against macro or geopolitical uncertainty. At the same time, WTI crude’s 2.6% weekly decline and the mildly weaker dollar indicate that energy and FX are not the primary drivers of current equity strength, leaving monetary policy expectations and year-end positioning as the dominant tape themes in risk terms.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The next 24 hours are likely to be driven by the full reopening of U.S. markets after the Black Friday early close, plus any scheduled U.S. economic data and Fed-related commentary referenced in pre-market coverage, such as employment or inflation prints and policy speeches; these can shift rate-cut expectations and thus equity risk appetite. In addition, any follow-up communication from CME Group or exchanges regarding the recent futures outage could influence confidence in futures liquidity, though the impact so far has been limited. Earnings-specific catalysts are not highlighted in the provided data, so macro releases and policy rhetoric remain the key near-term triggers.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence. Broad-based equity strength over the last day and week, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–4.2% on the week and the Russell 2000 up 6.46% over 7 days, points to solid upside momentum. The VIX has collapsed by roughly 34% over the week to 16.35 while the 10Y yield is slightly lower over 7 days, a combination that typically supports further equity gains. Futures remain notably stronger than spot, especially in small caps, suggesting positive positioning into the next full session, though the recent CME outage and lack of a single dominant data catalyst temper confidence from being higher.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the major U.S. indices can sustain and extend their recent break higher, particularly with the S&P 500 near 6,849 and the Nasdaq Composite around 23,366 after solid 1d and 7d gains. Small caps deserve special attention: the Russell 2000 at roughly 2,500 on cash and 2,505 on futures has outperformed sharply over the last week, and whether that leadership persists will be a key tell for risk-on breadth. For an upside bias to hold, maintaining positive breadth (currently 12 up vs 3 down) and avoiding a sharp reversal in the VIX from its 16.35 level will be important. Overnight, focus should also remain on macro indicators that could affect the 10Y yield, currently about 4.02% after a 2.6% weekly decline, since a renewed back-up in yields could challenge the equity rally. Cross-asset signals in gold and crude bear monitoring: gold’s 3.1% 1d jump suggests some lingering demand for safety even as equities rally, while WTI crude’s 2.6% weekly drop may weigh on energy-related names despite the broader risk-on tone. Any fresh Fed commentary or U.S. data that either reinforce or undermine current rate-cut expectations will likely determine whether futures, which are currently 2–3.6% above prior levels depending on the index, can lead cash markets higher into the next session.

The 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day at 4.02% (+0.48% 1d) but has eased 2.6% over the week, suggesting rate pressure has not been an impediment to equities and is moderately supportive of risk.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health screens as strong based on the benchmark changes. The average 1d index move is about +0.62%, and breadth shows 12 instruments up versus only 3 down, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow mega-cap rally.
