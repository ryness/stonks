  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is tentatively improving on a 1-day basis as US equities bounced and volatility eased. The S&P 500 rose 0.38%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.59%, and the Dow added 0.10% while small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 down 0.04%. The VIX fell 10.48% to 21.18, signaling calmer near-term sentiment, though it remains elevated versus a week (+22.57%) and month (+28.91%) ago.
  
  Index futures reinforce the rebound tone: S&P futures are up 0.98%, Nasdaq futures +1.27%, Dow futures +0.47%, and Russell futures +0.58%. This follows a weak 7-day stretch across benchmarks (S&P -2.78%, Nasdaq -4.09%, Dow -2.60%, Russell -4.39%), indicating the bounce is corrective so far rather than a full risk-on shift.
  
  Rates are relatively steady with the 10Y Treasury yield at 4.13% (+0.24% 1d), a backdrop that neither materially pressures nor turbocharges equities. Taken together—equities up, futures firm, VIX down, and yields stable—the near-term tone has improved, but the elevated VIX and recent weekly drawdowns show risk appetite is still fragile.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive today. Breadth shows 11 up vs 4 down and the average index change is +0.34%, pointing to a broad but modest rebound. The VIX’s 10.48% drop to 21.18 supports the improvement, yet its 7-day and 30-day rises keep overall risk premia elevated. With the 10Y Treasury yield steady near 4.13% (+0.24% 1d), the rates backdrop is not a major headwind, but recent weekly equity losses temper the signal.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed toward mega-cap growth, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.59% as a standout on the day, while the Russell 2000 lagged at -0.04%. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed the most (Russell 2000 -4.39%, Nasdaq Composite -4.09%), while the Dow was the relative leader despite still being lower (Dow 30 -2.60%).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Earnings focus around Nvidia is a key macro driver, with multiple reports noting investors are awaiting its Q3 results after a tech-led selloff. This concentration in AI leadership has amplified volatility; a solid print could encourage risk-on in growth indices, while a miss risks extending recent tech underperformance (risk-off). Global risk tone was pressured by reports of a tech-induced selloff and soft U.S. labor indicators, which weighed on stocks earlier in the week. This helped lift the VIX over the 7-day window, a sign of lingering caution that keeps markets sensitive to incremental data and earnings headlines (risk-off bias if weakness persists). Energy headlines point to weaker oil demand and oversupply fears, which can cap inflation impulses but also signal softer growth. Meanwhile, commentary about fading rate-cut hopes and hawkish FOMC signals has been cited as spooking markets, aligning with higher volatility and broad equity drawdowns over the week (risk-off), even as today’s bounce improves the near-term tape.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia’s Q3 earnings after the close are the primary near-term catalyst and could swing the Nasdaq and broader risk sentiment. US jobs data referenced in reports remains in focus for rate and growth cues that could move yields and equity futures. Some market commentary also flags Fed minutes as a potential volatility event, with any hawkish tone likely to weigh on risk assets.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — Index futures are green (ES +0.98%, NQ +1.27%, RTY +0.58%) and the VIX fell 10.48% to 21.18 alongside positive breadth (11 up, 4 down) and a +0.34% average index gain, suggesting a constructive setup into the next session; confidence is tempered by elevated weekly drawdowns and the event risk around Nvidia’s earnings.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether tech leadership holds: Nasdaq futures at 25,035.25 and QQQ at 599.87 need to sustain gains into and after Nvidia’s report to validate the bounce. Monitor the VIX at 21.18 after its 10.48% 1-day drop; continued compression would support an ‘up’ bias, while a snapback would challenge it. Track participation outside mega-cap tech: the Russell 2000 (2,347.89) and Russell futures (2,368.50) have lagged on a 7-day view (-4.39% and -3.96% respectively); improvement there would strengthen market breadth. Keep an eye on the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.13% and the US Dollar at 100.18 for any rate or dollar moves around jobs data that could influence equity follow-through.
