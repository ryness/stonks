  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are broadly risk-on, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day and week. The S&P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over 7 days, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81% and 1.08%, and the Russell 2000 is outperforming with a 0.78% daily gain and 4.94% over the week. ETFs echo this tone, with QQQ up 1.00% on the day and SPY up 0.66%, indicating solid appetite for both large-cap and growth exposure.","Volatility is easing alongside the equity bid: the VIX is down 6.21% on the day to 14.49 and nearly 22% over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite and a willingness to sell protection. Equity futures confirm the constructive tone, with S&P futures up 0.62%, Nasdaq futures up 0.98%, Dow futures up 0.47%, and Russell futures up 0.71% on the day. Rates are mildly supportive, with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.29% on the day to 4.17% but still 4.22% higher over 30 days, suggesting risk-on sentiment coexisting with a firmer macro backdrop rather than a pure "lower-yields chase."","Cross-asset signals reinforce a pro-risk environment but with some hedging and macro sensitivity: crude is up 2.35% on the day and 2.02% over the week, and gold is up 0.91% on the day and 8.48% over 30 days, showing demand for both cyclical and defensive commodities. The US Dollar Index is modestly stronger on the day and week but slightly lower over 30 days, a neutral to mildly supportive backdrop for global risk. Overall, risk appetite is improving, quantified by 13 up assets versus 2 down, an average index gain of about 0.73% on the day, and a low, falling VIX.",""]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong in the near term. Breadth is positive with 13 assets up versus only 2 down, and the average 1-day index move of roughly +0.73% points to a broad-based advance rather than a narrow rally. The VIX at 14.49 and down 6.21% on the day indicates a calm volatility regime, while the 10Y Treasury yield dipping 0.29% to 4.17% removes some immediate rate pressure. Despite yields being about 4.2% higher over 30 days, equities have climbed across the board, suggesting a resilient tape supported by constructive macro expectations.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is skewed toward growth and small caps: the QQQ ETF is a notable positive standout, up 1.00% on the day, and the Russell 2000 index is up 0.78%, with its futures up 0.71%. On a 1-week basis, the Russell 2000 leads with a 4.94% gain, followed by the Dow 30 up 2.35%. On the negative side, there are very few laggards; among the listed assets, the 10Y Treasury is down 0.29% on the day and the VIX is down 6.21%, but these are declines in defensive instruments rather than equity benchmarks, underscoring that leadership is firmly in risk assets.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro optimism around the US economy is a key driver, as highlighted by headlines noting that "stocks push higher on US economic optimism" and jobs data that "seals rate bets" while still allowing major indices to rise. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are all up between about 0.48% and 0.81% on the day, and the 10Y yield is only slightly lower at 4.17%, suggesting equities are embracing resilient growth even as the market accepts fewer near-term Fed cuts. This combination tends to support a risk-on tape, especially in cyclicals and growth sectors.","Policy and legal developments around tariffs are another central theme. News flow emphasizes a potential Supreme Court ruling on Trump-era tariffs and flags today as a "triple-threat" for volatility alongside jobs data and Fed commentary, though realized volatility is actually down with the VIX off 6.21% on the day. Equities moving higher despite tariff uncertainty implies markets are currently interpreting the risk as manageable or skewed toward a market-friendly outcome, which is supportive of risk-taking but leaves room for abrupt re-pricing if the ruling surprises.","Geopolitical tensions, particularly around Venezuela, are present but so far have had a counterintuitive risk-on effect. Coverage notes that Wall Street is "cheering" prospects around the Venezuela conflict and that prior sessions saw US indices rally nearly 1% on strength in energy, AI, and defense stocks following news of a US military operation there. Today, WTI crude's 2.35% daily gain and gold's 0.91% rise show that while risk appetite is strong in equities, investors are simultaneously bidding up traditional geopolitical hedges, indicating a nuanced tape where conflict underpins certain sectors and commodities without derailing broader risk-on sentiment.",""]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the main potential movers are the anticipated US Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariff powers, which could significantly affect equity and bond sentiment depending on whether tariffs are upheld or curtailed, and ongoing interpretation of the latest US jobs data that "seals rate bets," which will influence expectations for Fed policy. In addition, scheduled Fed-related commentary highlighted in coverage of a "triple-threat" volatility day could shift rate expectations and risk appetite if the tone diverges from current market pricing. Outside the US, China's CPI release is flagged as in focus for Asia-Pacific markets and could impact global risk sentiment via its implications for Chinese growth and policy support.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% — The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based gains across major US indices (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%), confirming futures strength (Nasdaq futures +0.98%, S&P futures +0.62%), and a 6.21% drop in the VIX to 14.49, all signaling improving risk appetite. The backdrop of US economic optimism and jobs data that confirm current rate expectations is currently being interpreted positively by equities. The main risk to this bias is event-driven: the pending Supreme Court tariff ruling and any unexpected Fed communication could trigger volatility and briefly reverse flows, but the prevailing tape and breadth favor a continuation of the grind higher.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures can hold and extend their current gains of 0.62% and 0.98%, respectively, as a signal that today's risk-on tone can carry into the next session; any sharp reversal in futures around the Supreme Court tariff headlines would be a warning sign. The Russell 2000, up 4.94% over the week and 6.42% over 30 days, is a key sentiment gauge: sustained strength in small-cap futures (currently +0.71% on the day) would confirm broad risk appetite, while underperformance versus large caps could hint at a near-term pause in the rally.","On the macro side, focus should remain on the 10Y Treasury yield, now at 4.17% and only slightly lower on the day, to ensure that any move back toward recent highs does not pressure equities. Traders should also track cross-asset hedges: a continued slide in the VIX from 14.49 and stable-to-firm crude oil (WTI +2.35% today) would be consistent with the projected upward bias, whereas a sudden VIX spike or outsized jump in gold, already up 8.48% over 30 days, would signal demand for protection and potential near-term turbulence around the tariff ruling or follow-through reactions to the jobs data.",""]

["Equities are broadly risk-on, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day and week.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong in the near term.
