  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are in a clear risk-on mode, with all major U.S. indices higher on the day and an average 1d index gain of about 0.73%. The S&P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over the week, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81% on the day, and small caps (Russell 2000) are stronger still at +0.78% on the day and +4.94% over the week, indicating broadening participation. Record-high headlines for the S&P 500 tied to U.S. economic optimism underscore improving risk appetite.","Volatility and futures pricing confirm this constructive tone. The VIX is down 6.21% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days to 14.49, signaling subdued demand for protection even as indices climb. Index futures mirror spot strength, with S&P futures up 0.62%, Nasdaq futures up 0.98%, Dow futures up 0.47%, and Russell futures up 0.71% on the day, while 10Y yields are slightly softer on the day (-0.29%) but higher over 30 days (+4.22%), consistent with markets pricing stronger growth rather than imminent easing. Overall, risk appetite is improving, not fading, with higher equities, lower implied volatility, and firm but contained rates.","Cross-asset signals are mixed but do not negate the pro-risk tone. Gold futures are up 1.15% on the day and 8.74% over 30 days, and WTI crude has risen 2.35% on the day, suggesting some hedging and growth/commodity demand alongside the equity rally. The dollar index is modestly higher on the day (+0.21%) and week (+0.91%) as Fed rate cut expectations recede, but the modest FX move versus stronger equities and lower VIX indicates equity investors remain comfortable with the current macro backdrop."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is very positive with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1d index change of roughly +0.73% shows gains are not narrowly concentrated. Volatility is subdued with the VIX at 14.49 and down 6.21% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days, while the 10Y Treasury yield is only slightly lower on the day at 4.17% but higher over the month, aligning with an economy viewed as resilient rather than stressed. Taken together, broad upside across indices, low volatility, and stable-to-firm yields point to a healthy risk environment for now.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from growth and small caps, with the QQQ ETF up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81%. Over the week, small caps are notable standouts, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.73%, outpacing large-cap benchmarks like the S&P 500 (+1.02%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.08%). On the downside, there are no major equity benchmarks in the red on the day; the relative laggard among the primary U.S. indices is the Dow 30, which is still positive but up a smaller 0.48% on the day versus tech and small-cap peers.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy expectations are a key driver of the tape, with news citing U.S. economic optimism and a 4.3% GDP gain supporting the S&P 500's rally to a new record high. A recent U.S. payrolls report has helped cement the view that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates imminently, which, alongside receding rate cut expectations and a firmer dollar, points to a growth-led rather than liquidity-led equity bid. This combination has been risk-on for stocks, as evidenced by broad index gains and falling VIX, even as longer-term yields remain elevated versus 30 days ago.","Geopolitical and policy headlines are influencing sector and cross-asset moves but not derailing overall risk appetite. Coverage of U.S. actions in Venezuela and potential Supreme Court rulings on tariffs has been framed as a "triple-threat" volatility backdrop, yet the actual outcome in the data is modest dollar strength (+0.21% on the day), higher oil (+2.35%), and rising defense/energy-related sentiment without a broad equity selloff. These catalysts tilt individual groups and commodities but have so far translated into a nuanced risk-on environment for equities rather than a decisive risk-off move.","Crypto and AI-related narratives continue to color risk sentiment at the margin. Articles highlight Bitcoin trading in a relatively tight range and far milder drawdowns than past cycles, as well as ongoing enthusiasm and scrutiny around AI leaders and capex, reinforcing a broader appetite for growth and speculative assets. While these stories are secondary to macro data and Fed expectations, they align with the observed strength in Nasdaq-linked benchmarks (Nasdaq up 0.81% on the day, Nasdaq futures up 0.98%), supporting a constructive risk tone in growth equities."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** In the next 24 hours, markets could react to developments around the pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Trump-era tariffs, which coverage notes could significantly affect stocks and bonds depending on whether tariff powers are curtailed or upheld. Any follow-on commentary or data related to the recent U.S. jobs report and its implications for Fed policy, as highlighted by reports that payrolls data "sealed" rate bets, may also move rates and equity indices if expectations on cuts shift. Additionally, scheduled China inflation data for Asia-Pacific trading has been flagged, and surprises there could influence global risk sentiment, particularly via futures and commodity pricing. Company-specific earnings like J Sainsbury's recent update show that individual reports can move select names, but the dominant potential macro trigger remains the tariff ruling and associated policy commentary.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – Major U.S. indices are all positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%) with strong weekly gains, and futures are similarly firm (Nasdaq futures +0.98%, S&P futures +0.62%), while the VIX is down 6.21% to 14.49, indicating improving risk appetite. Macro news points to U.S. economic optimism and solid growth, and although a Supreme Court tariff ruling is a potential source of volatility, current pricing across equities, volatility, and rates favors a modestly higher bias over the next 24 hours rather than a reversal. The confidence is not higher because policy outcomes around tariffs and ongoing Fed-related headlines could quickly shift sentiment.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch how S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures trade around current levels (S&P futures 7,005 and Nasdaq futures 25,938.25) to confirm whether the recent breakout and record-high narrative can extend. Monitoring the VIX around the mid-teens (14.49 currently) will be important: sustained levels near or below here would be consistent with the projected upward bias, while any sharp spike would signal hedging and a potential challenge to the risk-on move. Small caps via the Russell 2000 and its futures (last 2,624.22 and 2,636.90, respectively) are also key tells, given their leadership over 7 and 30 days.","On the macro and policy front, traders should closely track headlines around the U.S. Supreme Court tariff case and any follow-up interpretation of the recent payrolls report for Fed rate expectations, as prior coverage has flagged this combination as a potential volatility cluster. Moves in the 10Y yield around 4.17% and the dollar index near 99.14 will help gauge whether the market continues to view the backdrop as growth-positive without aggressive tightening risk. In commodities, WTI crude at about $59.12 and gold at $4,500.90 are worth watching for confirmation that the current mix of higher risk assets, firm growth, and modest hedging remains intact and supportive of the predicted upward drift in equities."]

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

["Equities are in a clear risk-on mode, with all major U.S. indices higher on the day and an average 1d index gain of about 0.73%. The S&P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over the week, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81% on the day, and small caps (Russell 2000) are stronger still at +0.78% on the day and +4.94% over the week, indicating broadening participation. Record-high headlines for the S&P 500 tied to U.S. economic optimism underscore improving risk appetite.","Volatility and futures pricing confirm this constructive tone. The VIX is down 6.21% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days to 14.49, signaling subdued demand for protection even as indices climb. Index futures mirror spot strength, with S&P futures up 0.62%, Nasdaq futures up 0.98%, Dow futures up 0.47%, and Russell futures up 0.71% on the day, while 10Y yields are slightly softer on the day (-0.29%) but higher over 30 days (+4.22%), consistent with markets pricing stronger growth rather than imminent easing. Overall, risk appetite is improving, not fading, with higher equities, lower implied volatility, and firm but contained rates.","Cross-asset signals are mixed but do not negate the pro-risk tone. Gold futures are up 1.15% on the day and 8.74% over 30 days, and WTI crude has risen 2.35% on the day, suggesting some hedging and growth/commodity demand alongside the equity rally. The dollar index is modestly higher on the day (+0.21%) and week (+0.91%) as Fed rate cut expectations recede, but the modest FX move versus stronger equities and lower VIX indicates equity investors remain comfortable with the current macro backdrop."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is very positive with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1d index change of roughly +0.73% shows gains are not narrowly concentrated. Volatility is subdued with the VIX at 14.49 and down 6.21% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days, while the 10Y Treasury yield is only slightly lower on the day at 4.17% but higher over the month, aligning with an economy viewed as resilient rather than stressed. Taken together, broad upside across indices, low volatility, and stable-to-firm yields point to a healthy risk environment for now.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from growth and small caps, with the QQQ ETF up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81%. Over the week, small caps are notable standouts, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.73%, outpacing large-cap benchmarks like the S&P 500 (+1.02%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.08%). On the downside, there are no major equity benchmarks in the red on the day; the relative laggard among the primary U.S. indices is the Dow 30, which is still positive but up a smaller 0.48% on the day versus tech and small-cap peers.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy expectations are a key driver of the tape, with news citing U.S. economic optimism and a 4.3% GDP gain supporting the S&P 500's rally to a new record high. A recent U.S. payrolls report has helped cement the view that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates imminently, which, alongside receding rate cut expectations and a firmer dollar, points to a growth-led rather than liquidity-led equity bid.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** In the next 24 hours, markets could react to developments around the pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Trump-era tariffs, which coverage notes could significantly affect stocks and bonds depending on whether tariff powers are curtailed or upheld. Any follow-on commentary or data related to the recent U.S. jobs report and its implications for Fed policy, as highlighted by reports that payrolls data "sealed" rate bets, may also move rates and equity indices if expectations on cuts shift. Additionally, scheduled China inflation data for Asia-Pacific trading has been flagged, and surprises there could influence global risk sentiment, particularly via futures and commodity pricing. Company-specific earnings like J Sainsbury's recent update show that individual reports can move select names, but the dominant potential macro trigger remains the tariff ruling and associated policy commentary.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – Major U.S. indices are all positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%) with strong weekly gains, and futures are similarly firm (Nasdaq futures +0.98%, S&P futures +0.62%), while the VIX is down 6.21% to 14.49, indicating improving risk appetite. Macro news points to U.S. economic optimism and solid growth, and although a Supreme Court tariff ruling is a potential source of volatility, current pricing across equities, volatility, and rates favors a modestly higher bias over the next 24 hours rather than a reversal. The confidence is not higher because policy outcomes around tariffs and ongoing Fed-related headlines could quickly shift sentiment.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch how S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures trade around current levels (S&P futures 7,005 and Nasdaq futures 25,938.25) to confirm whether the recent breakout and record-high narrative can extend. Monitoring the VIX around the mid-teens (14.49 currently) will be important: sustained levels near or below here would be consistent with the projected upward bias, while any sharp spike would signal hedging and a potential challenge to the risk-on move.

Moves in the 10Y yield around 4.17% and the dollar index near 99.14 will help gauge whether the market continues to view the backdrop as growth-positive without aggressive tightening risk. In commodities, WTI crude at about $59.12 and gold at $4,500.90 are worth watching for confirmation that the current mix of higher risk assets, firm growth, and modest hedging remains intact and supportive of the predicted upward drift in equities."]
