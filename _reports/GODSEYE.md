  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Across equities and futures, the tone is constructive and moderately risk-on. Major U.S. indices are all green on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.32%, Dow 30 up 0.60%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.22%, and Russell 2000 up 0.27%, while corresponding futures add roughly 0.26%–0.55%. On a 7-day view, gains are broader and stronger, led by Nasdaq futures (+3.14%) and Russell futures (+1.24%), confirming improving risk appetite rather than a one-day blip.",
      "Volatility and rates are reinforcing the risk-on message. The VIX is down 3.79% on the day and roughly 18% over the week to 13.47, signaling compressed equity risk premia and benign hedging demand. The 10-year Treasury yield is lower by 0.79% on the day and 1.10% over the week to 4.14, which, combined with modest dollar softness over 7 and 30 days, supports higher equity valuations and keeps financial conditions accommodative.",
      "In cross-asset terms, the risk tone is constructive but not euphoric. The average index change of about +0.34% today with 11 assets up versus 4 down indicates broad participation, while safe-haven gold is only marginally lower on the day (-0.05%) despite being up 9.10% over 30 days, suggesting investors are adding risk without fully unwinding hedges. Overall, risk appetite is clearly improving, but the move is orderly rather than disorderly chasing."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears solidly positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is strong, with 11 instruments up versus 4 down and an average 1-day index gain of roughly 0.34%, showing broad participation rather than a narrow rally. Volatility is subdued, with the VIX down nearly 4% today and over 18% on the week to 13.47, while the 10-year yield has eased about 0.8% on the day and 1.1% on the week, creating a supportive backdrop for risk assets. This combination of broad equity gains, falling volatility, and slightly lower yields points to a healthy, stable tape rather than a stressed or fractured market.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, the Dow 30 is a notable leader among major benchmarks, up 0.60%, with Dow futures similarly strong at +0.55%, while the Russell 2000 and Russell futures are more modest lagging gainers at +0.27% each. Over the last week, the Nasdaq complex is the standout, with the Nasdaq Composite up 2.41% and QQQ up 2.32%, and Nasdaq futures leading at +3.14%, whereas the Dow 30 lags on a 7-day basis with a smaller gain of 0.65%. On the downside, WTI crude is flat-to-soft on the day (-0.05%) and remains the clear 30-day laggard at -4.41%, contrasting with strong 30-day leadership from small caps (Russell 2000 +3.65%, Russell futures +4.05%) and gold (+9.10%).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "Macro data and growth narratives are central to the current tape. Headlines highlight that the U.S. economy expanded at a 4.3% GDP pace, described as the fastest in years, and commentary emphasizes that this challenges "vibecession" concerns and underscores a still-resilient backdrop. Strong growth alongside falling 10-year yields over the past week (-1.10%) and record-level U.S. indices supports a risk-on environment where equities can grind higher on expectations of solid earnings and manageable macro headwinds.",
      "Monetary policy expectations and liquidity support are also key themes. News flow references the Federal Reserve's expected rate cuts as a pillar for the 2026 stock market and mentions Washington aiming a "cash bazooka" at banks and consumers, which is associated with Wall Street anticipating new all-time highs. This dovish-leaning policy narrative aligns with the observed decline in yields and sharp compression in the VIX (-22.05% over 30 days), reinforcing a risk-on bias across equities and futures as markets price in easier financial conditions.",
      "Cross-asset moves in commodities and metals complement the macro picture. Articles note that gold and silver have smashed record highs, with silver up over 140% in 2025 and gold futures up 9.10% over 30 days, which, together with equity records, point to strong liquidity and momentum across risk and real asset markets. While precious metals strength can carry a defensive hue, the concurrent equity rally, weaker dollar over 30 days (-1.49%), and upbeat growth headlines collectively frame this as a broadly supportive, liquidity-driven risk-on regime rather than a pure flight to safety."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete catalysts in the next 24 hours are limited to scheduled macro and market closures around the holiday period; available headlines mention upcoming ABS inflation data for Australia and shortened trading sessions in Asia and Europe, but no major U.S. data releases, Fed decisions, or marquee earnings are cited. Given the lack of specific U.S. events in the provided information and the holiday-shortened context, the main triggers are likely thin liquidity and follow-through on the existing record-high narrative, which can modestly amplify moves but does not introduce a defined directional macro shock.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — The most likely bias over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity gains today (S&P 500 +0.32%, Dow 30 +0.60%, Nasdaq Composite +0.22%), supportive futures (S&P +0.31%, Nasdaq +0.26%, Dow +0.55%), and compressed volatility with the VIX down 3.79% on the day and over 18% on the week. The 10-year yield drifting lower and news flow emphasizing strong U.S. growth and expectations for Fed easing reinforce a constructive risk backdrop. With no major new U.S. catalysts flagged and holiday-thinned trading, continuation of the existing drift higher is more probable than a sharp reversal, though lower volumes temper confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Overnight and into the next session, traders should watch whether index futures can hold and extend their recent highs, particularly S&P futures around 6,982.5 and Nasdaq futures near 25,880.5 after 7-day gains of 2.34% and 3.14%, respectively. Sustained trading above these levels would be consistent with the projected upward bias, especially if the VIX remains anchored near or below its current 13.47 after a 22% 30-day slide, confirming that hedging demand is not re-emerging.",
      "Sector-wise, the relative leadership of large caps and growth remains important, with the Nasdaq Composite up 2.41% and QQQ up 2.32% on the week versus a smaller 0.65% for the Dow, while small caps (Russell 2000 and Russell futures) have quietly outperformed over 30 days (~3.65%–4.05%). Traders should monitor whether this leadership mix persists, particularly in any follow-through in tech and AI-related names referenced in the news, as that would validate the risk-on narrative underpinning the expected upward drift. At the macro level, keep an eye on the 10-year yield holding near or below 4.14 and on gold's elevated level at 4,480.6; stability in yields alongside resilient risk assets and firm metals would signal that the current constructive regime remains intact into the next session."

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — The most likely bias over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity gains today (S&P 500 +0.32%, Dow 30 +0.60%, Nasdaq Composite +0.22%), supportive futures (S&P +0.31%, Nasdaq +0.26%, Dow +0.55%), and compressed volatility with the VIX down 3.79% on the day and over 18% on the week. The 10-year yield drifting lower and news flow emphasizing strong U.S. growth and expectations for Fed easing reinforce a constructive risk backdrop. With no major new U.S. catalysts flagged and holiday-thinned trading, continuation of the existing drift higher is more probable than a sharp reversal, though lower volumes temper confidence.
