  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-23T20:24:00.044337+00:00">2025-11-23 20:24 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 35s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite improved on the day with a broad equity rebound and supportive rates backdrop. The S&P 500 rose 0.98%, Dow 1.08%, Nasdaq 0.88%, and small caps led with the Russell 2000 up 2.80%, while futures echoed the bid (ES +0.96%, YM +1.08%, NQ +0.72%, RTY +2.80%).
  
  Volatility eased but remains elevated: the VIX fell 11.32% on the day to 23.43, yet is still up 33.81% over the week, underscoring lingering fragility. Rates aided the bounce as the 10Y Treasury yield slipped 1.05% to 4.06% on the day and is roughly flat over 7d (-0.05%), helping equities stabilize.
  
  Despite the intraday risk-on tone, the weekly tape is still risk-off: the S&P 500 (-3.62%), Nasdaq (-4.84%), and Dow (-4.16%) are lower over 7d. The session’s advance and lower yields signal improving near-term appetite, but the magnitude of recent drawdowns and elevated VIX temper conviction.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health improved on the day, with breadth showing 12 up vs. 3 down and an average index change of +1.25%. Volatility cooled (VIX -11.32% to 23.43), while the 10Y Treasury yield dipped to 4.06% (-1.05% 1d), a supportive combination for equities. However, the VIX remains elevated on a 7d basis (+33.81%) and major indices are still down 3%–5% over the week, flagging residual stress. Overall, conditions look healthier session-over-session but not fully repaired.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 2.80% on the day, while large-cap tech lagged as QQQ gained 0.75%. Over the week, the Nasdaq complex is the clear laggard (Nasdaq Composite -4.84% 7d; Nasdaq futures -5.14% 7d), whereas the Russell 2000’s smaller 7d decline (-3.31%) marks relative resilience despite still being negative. On the day, cyclicals and value proxies outperformed, while growth-heavy benchmarks were the softest gainers.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A key driver of Friday’s rebound was policy tone, with comments from a Federal Reserve official boosting confidence in the likelihood of an interest rate cut, according to Investopedia. That dovish read-through aligned with a 1.05% drop in the 10Y yield to 4.06% and an 11.32% pullback in the VIX, supporting a risk-on session. AI and mega-cap tech volatility remained a macro swing factor, as reports highlighted that Nvidia-related enthusiasm failed to sustain rallies earlier in the week, contributing to broad selling (MarketWatch, Fortune). The week’s risk-off footprint is visible in the Nasdaq’s 7d decline of 4.84% and the VIX’s 33.81% weekly surge, signaling that AI-led leadership wobbles are still weighing on overall sentiment. Policy discourse in Europe stayed in focus with ECB communications on fiscal policy and growth (ECB). While not a direct catalyst for U.S. indices in this tape, it adds to the macro policy watch that, alongside a firmer U.S. dollar over 7d (+0.72%), can dampen risk-taking at the margin.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The day’s broad bounce (avg index +1.25%) alongside a 1.05% dip in the 10Y and an 11.32% slide in the VIX argues for stabilization, but elevated weekly volatility (VIX +33.81% 7d) and persistent 7d equity losses (-3% to -5%) cap upside without fresh catalysts.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P 500 futures (6,620.25) can hold the session’s progress relative to cash (6,602.99); sustained trade above the cash close would support a stable open consistent with a flat bias. Small-cap leadership is a key tell: Russell 2000 at 2,369.59 and Russell futures at 2,375.30 should maintain relative strength to keep breadth constructive. Monitor volatility and rates for confirmation of stability: the VIX at 23.43 needs to stay contained or drift lower, and the 10Y yield around 4.06% should avoid backing up meaningfully. A steady-to-softer dollar (last 100.20) would further ease financial conditions, while renewed dollar strength could pressure growth benchmarks. Sector-wise, gauge whether QQQ (590.07) can firm after underperforming on the day (+0.75%); continued tech hesitation would favor rotation into Dow-style and small-cap exposures. Energy sensitivity remains in focus with WTI at 58.06 (-1.83% 1d), which could weigh on energy equities if weakness persists, while gold at 4,079.5 provides a barometer for hedging demand.
