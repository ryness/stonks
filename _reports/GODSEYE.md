  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities show a cautiously constructive tone with a pro‑cyclical tilt. The S&P 500 is up 0.19% on the day and 3.64% over 30 days, while the Dow leads large caps with a 0.66% 1d gain and nearly 5% over 30 days. Small caps are the clearest risk-on signal today, with the Russell 2000 up 1.06% on the day and 6.79% over 30 days, even as the Nasdaq is marginally negative on the day (-0.03%) and down 0.82% over the week, indicating some rotation away from recent tech leadership rather than broad de-risking.","Volatility and futures also point to improving risk appetite despite a mild tech consolidation. The VIX is down 2.94% on the day and over 41% in the last 30 days to 14.51, while S&P and Dow futures are modestly higher on the day (+0.12% and +0.58% respectively) and up about 4–5% over 30 days. In contrast, Nasdaq futures are off 0.28% today and down 1.19% over the week, suggesting risk-taking is shifting toward cyclicals and small caps rather than increasing indiscriminately.","Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly benign for equities, though not aggressively supportive. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 0.58% on the day and 1.55% over 30 days to 4.19, a modest rise that has not yet derailed equity gains. Gold is slightly lower on the day (-0.26%) and over the week, and crude is down 5.63% over 30 days, while the dollar is flat-to-softer over 30 days (-1.14%), all consistent with a moderate risk-on environment where inflation and growth fears are contained and equity risk appetite is gradually improving rather than surging."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears moderately positive. Breadth is constructive with 9 instruments up versus 6 down, and the average 1d index change of roughly +0.31% shows a broad, if modest, advance across benchmarks. A VIX at 14.51 and down nearly 3% on the day (and over 41% in 30 days) signals a calm volatility backdrop, while only a small uptick in the 10-year yield to 4.19 suggests rates are not yet a significant headwind. Taken together, this points to a reasonably healthy tape, with improving risk appetite but some lingering caution in growth/tech segments.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the standout leader with a 1.06% gain, and the Dow 30 is also strong at +0.66%, highlighting strength in cyclicals and small caps. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite lags with a -0.03% move and the QQQ ETF is similarly weak at -0.19%, indicating mild pressure in large-cap tech. Over the week, small caps and growth benchmarks have generally underperformed (Russell 2000 -1.98%, Nasdaq Composite -0.82%), while the Dow has been roughly flat (+0.04%), reinforcing that leadership has rotated toward more defensive or value-oriented large caps rather than high-beta tech.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy signals are a key driver of today's constructive equity tone. According to the Times of India summary, US stocks began 2026 with gains in the S&P 500 and Dow, helped by a rebound in technology shares and investor optimism after a strong 2025. The same piece notes that investors reacted favorably to policy signals, including a delay in tariff hikes, which directly supports a risk-on environment by reducing near-term trade uncertainty and improving visibility for corporate earnings.","Broader macro context from recent weeks also underpins the current appetite for risk. Prior coverage highlights that US GDP has been expanding at one of the fastest paces in years on resilient consumer and business spending, while 2025 saw double-digit equity gains powered by the AI trade, as noted by Yahoo Finance. These dynamics, combined with calmer trade policy and expectations of continued but more measured gains in 2026, support ongoing equity inflows and rotation within risk assets rather than a wholesale de-risking.","At the same time, some commentary points to lingering concerns that temper, but do not reverse, the risk-on tone. Articles referencing lingering trade deal doubts, a lack of fresh catalysts, and anticipated smaller index gains in 2026 suggest investors are becoming more selective, favoring stock- and sector-specific opportunities. This backdrop aligns with today's pattern of small-cap and Dow strength alongside Nasdaq softness, indicating a nuanced risk-on environment where macro tailwinds exist but investors are rotating leadership rather than indiscriminately adding equity beta."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term triggers in the next 24 hours are not clearly specified in the provided data, beyond generic references to events like upcoming FOMC minutes in prior days and ongoing policy discussions such as delayed tariff hikes; therefore, specific scheduled earnings, economic data releases, or policy decisions that could move the market in the next day are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The balance of evidence leans modestly higher over the next 24 hours. Broad indices are positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.19%, Dow +0.66%, Russell 2000 +1.06%) with 9 of 15 instruments advancing, while the VIX is down nearly 3% and sitting at a low 14.51, signaling supportive risk sentiment. Futures on the S&P and Dow are also up on the day and solidly higher over 30 days, and news flow highlights positive reactions to a delay in tariff hikes and optimism carrying over from strong 2025 performance, all of which favor a slight upward bias despite some ongoing weakness in Nasdaq/tech benchmarks.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether the pro-cyclical rotation persists, particularly in the Russell 2000 and Dow-linked futures. Russell 2000 cash at 2,508 and Russell futures at 2,522.5 are key reference points; sustained strength there alongside S&P 500 levels around 6,858 and S&P futures near 6,900.5 would confirm the current risk-on bias with a small-cap tilt. A continued VIX hold near or below the mid-teens, anchored around 14.5, would further validate a constructive near-term backdrop.","Sector-wise, monitoring tech-heavy benchmarks like the Nasdaq Composite at 23,235.6 and QQQ at 613.1 is important to see if today's mild underperformance stabilizes or extends. If Nasdaq futures around 25,385 continue to lag while Dow futures (48,616) and Russell futures outperform, that would reinforce rotation into value/cyclicals rather than broad de-risking. On the macro side, keep an eye on the 10-year yield near 4.19 and the US Dollar Index around 98.4; a stable-to-slightly higher yield and subdued dollar, together with soft commodities like WTI at 57.3, would remain consistent with the model's slight "up" bias into the next session."]
