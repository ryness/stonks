  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad rebound led by small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 2.80%, the Dow up 1.08%, the S&P 500 up 0.98%, and the Nasdaq up 0.88% on the day. However, risk appetite remains bruised over the last week, as the S&P 500 fell 3.62%, the Nasdaq dropped 4.84%, the Dow slipped 4.16%, and the Russell declined 3.31%.
  
  Volatility eased sharply on the day but is still elevated versus a week ago, with the VIX down 11.32% to 23.43 in 1d yet up 33.81% over 7d. Rates provided a tailwind, as the 10Y Treasury yield fell 1.05% on the day to 4.06% and was essentially flat over the week (-0.05%).
  
  Futures point to mild follow-through, with S&P futures up 0.43%, Nasdaq futures up 0.64%, Dow futures up 0.22%, and Russell futures up 0.40%. Cross-asset signals are mixed, as gold slipped 0.66% and WTI crude edged down 0.12% on the day while the US dollar strengthened 1.07% over the week, suggesting an improving but selective risk appetite.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health improved on the day with breadth showing 11 advancing and 4 declining benchmarks and an average index gain of 1.25%. The VIX fell 11.32% to 23.43, signaling cooling near-term stress, but its 33.81% rise over the week keeps overall conditions cautious. The 10Y Treasury yield declined 1.05% to 4.06%, easing financial conditions, and was flat over the week. Netting these signals, the tape looks like a relief bounce within a recently stressed environment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership favored small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 2.80% as the standout, while within large-cap tech the QQQ lagged the equity rebound at +0.75% and gold fell 0.66% on the day. Over the last week, the Nasdaq Composite (-4.84%) and Dow (-4.16%) underperformed, while the S&P 500 fell 3.62% and the Russell 2000 dropped 3.31%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fed-related optimism aided Friday’s bounce as comments from a Federal Reserve official boosted confidence in the likelihood of an interest rate cut, per Investopedia. That pushed a risk-on tilt into equities and helped bring the VIX down 11.32% on the day while the 10Y yield fell 1.05% to 4.06%, easing rate-sensitive pressure. Concerns around the AI/tech complex were a key drag earlier, with reports of global de-risking in crypto and AI and a Nvidia-inspired rebound that faltered, per Fortune and MarketWatch. This aligns with the Nasdaq’s 4.84% weekly drop and the VIX’s 33.81% weekly jump, reinforcing a risk-off undertone despite the late-week rally. Broadly, a turbulent week left major indexes with sharp weekly losses even after a bounce, as highlighted by Yahoo. Regional spillovers tied to tech weakness were noted by CNBC, and the stronger US dollar over the week (+1.07%) added a headwind to risk assets.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — Overnight futures are green (ES +0.43%, NQ +0.64%) following a strong breadth-led rebound and a 11.32% drop in the VIX alongside a 1.05% decline in the 10Y yield to 4.06%. Supportive Fed commentary helped the bounce, though elevated weekly volatility and recent tech-led losses temper confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P futures around 6,649 and Nasdaq futures near 24,461 hold gains into the open, and whether the VIX continues to ease from 23.43 rather than re-accelerating. Sustained small-cap leadership would confirm improving risk appetite after the Russell 2000’s 2.80% surge. Monitor rate and dollar dynamics as confirmation: the 10Y Treasury near 4.06% staying contained would support equities, while a firm US dollar at 100.24 could cap risk-on follow-through. Within sectors, track mega-cap tech for stabilization after AI-related pressure and compare QQQ’s recovery versus small caps to gauge the quality of the bid.
