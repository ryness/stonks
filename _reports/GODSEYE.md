  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad rebound, with the S&P 500 up 0.98%, Dow 1.08%, Nasdaq 0.88%, and Russell 2000 2.80% on the day, and breadth positive at 9 up versus 6 down. Despite the bounce, the 7-day tape remains weak (S&P −3.62%, Nasdaq −4.84%, Dow −4.16%, Russell −3.31%), so risk appetite improved on a 1-day basis but is still fading versus the past week.
  
  Volatility remains elevated even as it eased slightly today: the VIX sits at 23.32, down 0.47% on the day but up 16.60% over the week and 22.54% over 30 days, signaling lingering stress. That profile implies risk-taking is tentative, with any rallies occurring against a higher-vol backdrop than earlier in the month.
  
  Futures point to a cautious positive bias into the next session, with S&P futures +0.18%, Nasdaq futures +0.37%, and Russell futures +0.08% while Dow futures are −0.05%. Rates are incrementally supportive, as the 10Y Treasury yield slipped 1.05% to 4.06, which helps offset some of the risk-off impulse from the still-high VIX.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health improved on the day, with average index change up 1.25% and 9 benchmarks rising versus 6 falling. However, the VIX at 23.32 is elevated and higher by 16.60% over the week, tempering the strength of the rebound. The 10Y Treasury yield eased 1.05% to 4.06, a supportive offset for equities. Net, this looks like a constructive short-term bounce within a still-choppy, risk-aware backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Small caps led sharply, with the Russell 2000 up 2.80% on the day, while the S&P 500 and Dow gained 0.98% and 1.08%, respectively. On the flip side, Dow futures were a mild detractor at −0.05% on the day and QQQ lagged major equity ETFs at +0.75%. Over the week, the Nasdaq Composite was the notable laggard at −4.84% while the Russell 2000 was the relative outperformer at −3.31%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Policy expectations helped steady sentiment late in the week, as Investopedia noted major U.S. indexes gained Friday afternoon on comments from a Federal Reserve official that boosted confidence in the likelihood of an interest rate cut. That narrative was conducive to a risk-on tone and aligns with the day’s leadership in small caps and the drop in the 10Y yield. At the same time, multiple reports highlighted a turbulent stretch marked by AI-trade wobbles and a spike in the VIX, with Yahoo noting sharp weekly losses and Fortune and MarketWatch pointing to broad selling tied to valuation concerns and elevated volatility. This backdrop maintains a risk-off overhang even as markets attempt to bounce. Macro dispersion adds caution, with Business Insider flagging that several parts of the U.S. economy are already in recession. Such sector-specific weakness can cap cyclicals’ momentum and keep investors biased toward quality and defensives despite intermittent rallies.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 58% because futures are modestly higher (ES +0.18%, NQ +0.37%), breadth improved (9 up vs 6 down) with a 1.25% average index gain, the VIX eased 0.47% on the day, and the 10Y yield fell 1.05% to 4.06, though confidence is tempered by the VIX’s elevated 23.32 level and weak 7-day equity performance.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures levels and tone: S&P futures near 6,632, Nasdaq futures around 24,396, Dow futures near 46,296, and Russell futures around 2,377. A stable to firmer drift in ES and NQ alongside a VIX that grinds lower from 23.32 would support the constructive bias. Monitor rates and the dollar as tailwinds: the 10Y Treasury at 4.06 and the U.S. Dollar Index near 100.10. Continued softness in yields and a steady-to-softer dollar would be supportive for equities, particularly given QQQ’s relative lag (+0.75%) versus the Russell 2000’s strength (+2.80%). Keep an eye on cyclical signals via commodities: WTI crude at 57.53 and gold at 4,070. Persistent pressure in oil alongside contained gold and lower volatility would align with a modest risk-on tone, while reversals there could challenge the equity bounce.
