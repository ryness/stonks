  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a cautious rebound: S&P 500 +0.34%, Nasdaq Composite +0.53%, and Russell 2000 +0.44%, while the Dow remains heavy after a prior -1.65% drop. Risk appetite is stabilizing on the day but has faded over the week, with the S&P 500 -0.53%, Nasdaq -2.16%, and Russell 2000 -2.90% over 7 days.
  
  Volatility and rates still lean risk-off: the VIX rose 0.95% to 20.19 and is up 12.10% over the week and 21.26% over 30 days, keeping a defensive tone. The 10Y Treasury yield ticked up 0.73% on the day to 4.14 (7d -0.36%), suggesting tighter financial conditions at the margin.
  
  Futures imply a modest risk-on tilt skewed to growth and small caps: S&P +0.27%, Nasdaq +0.41%, and Russell +0.49%, while Dow futures lag at -0.39%. However, weekly futures moves remain negative for ES (-0.69%), NQ (-2.13%), and RTY (-2.89%), indicating risk appetite has softened on a multi-day basis despite today’s bounce.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive on the day but fragile in trend. Breadth is positive (12 up, 3 down) and the average index change is a modest +0.08%, signaling stabilization rather than strong risk-on. Elevated volatility (VIX 20.19, +12.10% 7d) and a firm 10Y yield at 4.14 (+0.73% 1d) temper the intraday improvement. Overall, conditions look only fair given weak 7-day performance and still-elevated vol.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is mixed: on the day the Nasdaq Composite leads at +0.53% while the Dow 30 lags at -1.65%. Over the last week, the Dow 30 is the relative winner at +0.79%, while small caps and tech underperformed with the Russell 2000 -2.90% and the Nasdaq Composite -2.16%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment is pressured by a tech-led sell-off and fears about the Chinese economy, following what was described as Wall Street’s worst day in a month and an unprecedented slump in investment in China. This backdrop supports a risk-off bias, consistent with the VIX holding at 20.19 (+12.10% 7d) and weak 7-day returns for Nasdaq (-2.16%) and Russell (-2.90%). US headlines note the government reopening alongside missing jobs and inflation data, with the report citing rising yields, faster tech selling, and a volatility jump. That aligns with today’s firm 10Y yield (+0.73% to 4.14) and elevated VIX (+0.95% 1d), reinforcing a cautious tape even as major indices bounce intraday. Geopolitical tension around the semiconductor supply chain surfaced as China voiced ‘extreme disappointment’ with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip row. Such headlines are a potential headwind for chip-exposed equities and broader risk sentiment, complementing the recent underperformance in tech benchmarks (Nasdaq 7d -2.16%).
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** A heavy slate of India Q2 corporate results (e.g., Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, Siemens India, Max Healthcare, Marico) is slated for today, which could influence Asia risk tone and related EM sentiment; no major US macro releases are flagged in the provided data.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% - Modest gains in S&P/Nasdaq/Russell and firmer futures (ES +0.27%, NQ +0.41%, RTY +0.49%) are offset by elevated and rising volatility (VIX 20.19, +0.95% 1d; +12.10% 7d), a firmer 10Y yield (+0.73% to 4.14), and weak 7-day performance across growth and small caps. News flow remains cautious (tech sell-off, China worries), arguing for range-bound trade.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures levels for confirmation: ES=F near 6,778 with 6,825 (7d reference) as nearby resistance and 6,764 (30d reference) as support; NQ=F near 25,198 with 25,746 (7d reference) as resistance and 24,992 (30d reference) as support. A VIX hold around 20.19 versus its 7d reference at 18.01 will signal whether volatility stays a headwind to sustained upside. Monitor tech and semis leadership given recent selling and chip supply-chain headlines: QQQ is +0.47% on the day but -1.92% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is +0.53% 1d and -2.16% 7d. Small caps also bear watching as a risk barometer: RTY=F +0.49% 1d but -2.89% 7d, with 2,473 (7d reference) as an overhead marker. Track macro proxies: the 10Y Treasury at 4.14 (+0.73% 1d) remains pivotal—sustained firmness versus its 7d reference (4.157) would keep financial conditions tight. Also note the US Dollar at 99.31 (+0.13% 1d) and gold at 4,095 (-2.19% 1d) as barometers of risk appetite; if VIX remains elevated and yields firm, sideways price action is more likely.

## 1. Pulse

Equities show a cautious rebound: S&P 500 +0.34%, Nasdaq Composite +0.53%, and Russell 2000 +0.44%, while the Dow remains heavy after a prior -1.65% drop. Risk appetite is stabilizing on the day but has faded over the week, with the S&P 500 -0.53%, Nasdaq -2.16%, and Russell 2000 -2.90% over 7 days.

Volatility and rates still lean risk-off: the VIX rose 0.95% to 20.19 and is up 12.10% over the week and 21.26% over 30 days, keeping a defensive tone. The 10Y Treasury yield ticked up 0.73% on the day to 4.14 (7d -0.36%), suggesting tighter financial conditions at the margin.

Futures imply a modest risk-on tilt skewed to growth and small caps: S&P +0.27%, Nasdaq +0.41%, and Russell +0.49%, while Dow futures lag at -0.39%. However, weekly futures moves remain negative for ES (-0.69%), NQ (-2.13%), and RTY (-2.89%), indicating risk appetite has softened on a multi-day basis despite today’s bounce.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive on the day but fragile in trend. Breadth is positive (12 up, 3 down) and the average index change is a modest +0.08%, signaling stabilization rather than strong risk-on. Elevated volatility (VIX 20.19, +12.10% 7d) and a firm 10Y yield at 4.14 (+0.73% 1d) temper the intraday improvement. Overall, conditions look only fair given weak 7-day performance and still-elevated vol.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is mixed: on the day the Nasdaq Composite leads at +0.53% while the Dow 30 lags at -1.65%. Over the last week, the Dow 30 is the relative winner at +0.79%, while small caps and tech underperformed with the Russell 2000 -2.90% and the Nasdaq Composite -2.16%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment is pressured by a tech-led sell-off and fears about the Chinese economy, following what was described as Wall Street’s worst day in a month and an unprecedented slump in investment in China. This backdrop supports a risk-off bias, consistent with the VIX holding at 20.19 (+12.10% 7d) and weak 7-day returns for Nasdaq (-2.16%) and Russell (-2.90%). US headlines note the government reopening alongside missing jobs and inflation data, with the report citing rising yields, faster tech selling, and a volatility jump. That aligns with today’s firm 10Y yield (+0.73% to 4.14) and elevated VIX (+0.95% 1d), reinforcing a cautious tape even as major indices bounce intraday. Geopolitical tension around the semiconductor supply chain surfaced as China voiced ‘extreme disappointment’ with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip row. Such headlines are a potential headwind for chip-exposed equities and broader risk sentiment, complementing the recent underperformance in tech benchmarks (Nasdaq 7d -2.16%).

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** A heavy slate of India Q2 corporate results (e.g., Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, Siemens India, Max Healthcare, Marico) is slated for today, which could influence Asia risk tone and related EM sentiment; no major US macro releases are flagged in the provided data.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% - Modest gains in S&P/Nasdaq/Russell and firmer futures (ES +0.27%, NQ +0.41%, RTY +0.49%) are offset by elevated and rising volatility (VIX 20.19, +0.95% 1d; +12.10% 7d), a firmer 10Y yield (+0.73% to 4.14), and weak 7-day performance across growth and small caps. News flow remains cautious (tech sell-off, China worries), arguing for range-bound trade.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures levels for confirmation: ES=F near 6,778 with 6,825 (7d reference) as nearby resistance and 6,764 (30d reference) as support; NQ=F near 25,198 with 25,746 (7d reference) as resistance and 24,992 (30d reference) as support. A VIX hold around 20.19 versus its 7d reference at 18.01 will signal whether volatility stays a headwind to sustained upside. Monitor tech and semis leadership given recent selling and chip supply-chain headlines: QQQ is +0.47% on the day but -1.92% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is +0.53% 1d and -2.16% 7d. Small caps also bear watching as a risk barometer: RTY=F +0.49% 1d but -2.89% 7d, with 2,473 (7d reference) as an overhead marker. Track macro proxies: the 10Y Treasury at 4.14 (+0.73% 1d) remains pivotal—sustained firmness versus its 7d reference (4.157) would keep financial conditions tight. Also note the US Dollar at 99.31 (+0.13% 1d) and gold at 4,095 (-2.19% 1d) as barometers of risk appetite; if VIX remains elevated and yields firm, sideways price action is more likely.
