  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is risk-off with broad declines in major US indices and an average 1d index drop of about -1.93%. The S&P 500 fell -2.06%, the Nasdaq Composite -2.39%, and the Dow -1.76%, while small caps via the Russell 2000 were somewhat more resilient at -1.21%. This pullback comes after a weak week for large caps (e.g., Nasdaq -2.24% over 7d) even as small caps retain a stronger 30d profile (+4.51%), indicating fading risk appetite in mega-cap growth and more mixed sentiment down the cap spectrum.","Volatility and futures show tentative stabilization after the equity hit but not a full-throated risk-on turn. The VIX is slightly lower on the day (-1.64%) but remains elevated versus a week and month ago (+36% and +28%, respectively, to 19.76), signaling a higher-vol regime despite the intraday ease. Equity futures are modestly green (S&P +0.21%, Nasdaq +0.17%, Dow +0.10%, Russell +0.24%), suggesting a mild attempt to stabilize after the cash-session selloff rather than a decisive rebound.","Rates and cross-asset signals echo a defensive backdrop. The 10Y Treasury yield is grinding higher (4.30%, +1.51% 1d and +4.55% over 30d), undercutting equity valuations and reinforcing a risk-off tilt. Gold futures are acting as a clear safety and macro hedge, jumping +2.20% on the day and +15.46% over 30d, while the dollar is little changed on 1d but slightly softer over 7–30d; overall, risk appetite is fading, with elevated volatility and higher yields offsetting only modest overnight futures strength."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is fragile: breadth is nearly even with 7 instruments up and 8 down, but the average 1d index move of about -1.93% points to meaningful pressure across benchmarks. Large US indices all sold off more than -1.7%, led by the Nasdaq at -2.39%, while only the Russell 2000 showed relative resilience at -1.21%. The VIX, though down -1.64% on the day, is still roughly 36% above last week and 28% above last month at 19.76, confirming a higher underlying stress level. With the 10Y Treasury yield rising to 4.30% and up over 4.5% in 30 days, the combination of weaker equities, elevated volatility, and higher rates suggests a cautious to unhealthy tape rather than a stable environment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, the Russell 2000 is the relative leader among major US equity benchmarks, down a smaller -1.21% versus steeper losses in large caps, and Russell futures are actually up +0.24%. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is the clear laggard with a -2.39% 1d move, and its proxy QQQ ETF fell -2.12%, reflecting particular pressure in growth and tech-oriented names. Over the week, small caps also lead with the Russell 2000 up +1.59% and Russell futures +1.07%, while the Nasdaq Composite lags with a -2.24% 7d decline, underscoring a rotation away from mega-cap growth and toward smaller, more domestically oriented stocks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical tension around trade and tariffs is a central driver of the current risk-off tone. News citing a sharp selloff in US stock futures tied to Trump's Greenland tariff threats, with Dow and S&P 500 futures sinking more than 1.5%, aligns with the elevated VIX over the past week and the bid in gold (+8.33% over 7d). This type of policy shock has pushed investors toward hedges and safe havens, contributing to weaker global equity sentiment, as also reflected in Indian markets where Sensex and Nifty have been dragged lower by global trade uncertainty and foreign outflows—overall a clear risk-off impulse."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% While underlying cash indices had a distinctly risk-off session (S&P 500 -2.06%, Nasdaq -2.39%, average 1d index move about -1.93%), overnight equity futures are modestly positive (S&P +0.21%, Nasdaq +0.17%, Dow +0.10%, Russell +0.24%), suggesting some stabilization attempts. At the same time, macro stress is still evident in elevated VIX levels versus a week and month ago and a rising 10Y yield at 4.30%, while gold remains strongly bid. Given the tug-of-war between ongoing policy and trade concerns (e.g., tariff headlines) driving risk-off behavior and the current small bounce in futures after an overshoot day, the most balanced call for the next 24 hours is a broadly flat market with choppy, range-bound trade rather than a clear directional move.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should closely track whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can stabilize around current levels after the -2% to -2.4% declines, using futures marks (ES last 6,844 and NQ last 25,171.75) as reference points for any sustained bounce or relapse. Monitoring the VIX near 19.76 will be important: further compression from here would support the flat-to-slightly-positive bias, while a renewed push higher, particularly back toward or above the recent 7d gains, would signal that downside equity risk is reasserting itself.","Sector and macro cues consistent with a flat outlook include the behavior of small caps and traditional havens. Russell futures, up +0.24% on the day and +5.57% over 30d, are a key tell: continued relative strength in the Russell 2000 would hint at underlying domestic risk tolerance even if large caps churn. At the same time, traders should watch gold, which is extended after a +15.46% 30d run; if gold and the 10Y yield (now 4.30%) both keep grinding higher, it would signal that macro and tariff-related risk-off forces remain in play and could cap any equity rebound, keeping indices confined to a volatile but broadly flat range over the coming session."]

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Across equities, the tone is risk-off with broad declines in major US indices and an average 1d index drop of about -1.93%. The S&amp;P 500 fell -2.06%, the Nasdaq Composite -2.39%, and the Dow -1.76%, while small caps via the Russell 2000 were somewhat more resilient at -1.21%. This pullback comes after a weak week for large caps (e.g., Nasdaq -2.24% over 7d) even as small caps retain a stronger 30d profile (+4.51%), indicating fading risk appetite in mega-cap growth and more mixed sentiment down the cap spectrum.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and futures show tentative stabilization after the equity hit
