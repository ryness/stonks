  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad risk-on rebound, led by the Nasdaq Composite up 2.69% and supported by the S&P 500 up 1.55% and Russell 2000 up 1.89%, while the Dow 30 lagged at +0.44%. Breadth skewed positive (10 up, 5 down) and the average 1-day index change was 1.76%, signaling improving risk appetite.
  
  Volatility eased sharply as the VIX fell 12.42% to 20.52, though it remains 7.83% higher versus 30 days ago, so the backdrop is calmer but not complacent. Rates supported the equity bid with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.62% on the day to 4.04% (about 2.5 bps), reinforcing the risk-on tone.
  
  Overnight futures are essentially flat, with S&P futures +0.01%, Nasdaq futures -0.01%, Dow futures -0.06%, and Russell futures +0.02%, suggesting consolidation after the surge. Cross-asset signals are mixed as gold rose 1.28%, WTI crude slipped 0.27%, and the US Dollar edged up 0.09%, which tempers an otherwise better risk appetite.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health improved with a broad advance: 10 benchmarks rose versus 5 declined and the average 1-day index change was 1.76%. The VIX dropped 12.42% to 20.52, easing stress, but it remains up 7.83% over 30 days. The 10Y Treasury yield dipped to 4.04% (-0.62% 1d), providing a supportive backdrop for risk assets. Overall, conditions look moderately healthy with improving tone but volatility still elevated relative to the past month.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, the Nasdaq Composite led at +2.69% while the Dow 30 lagged at +0.44%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 is a relative leader at +1.31% while the Dow 30 is the notable laggard at -2.13% and the S&P 500 is modestly lower at -0.48%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Markets are responding to rising US rate cut bets following comments from New York Fed President John Williams, which coincided with a broad equity rally (Nasdaq +2.69%, S&P 500 +1.55%) and a drop in the 10Y yield to 4.04% (-0.62% 1d). This is a risk-on catalyst that also helped compress the VIX by 12.42%. An emerging data vacuum and reported economic data delays are shaping a quieter tape, as noted in coverage of a bond rally facing fewer catalysts and reports that delays are adding to the waiting game. This skews near-term behavior toward range-bound risk with flat-to-mixed futures (ES +0.01%, NQ -0.01%) despite improved sentiment. Recent turbulence linked to AI-led valuations and selloff headlines remains a backdrop risk, with coverage highlighting an AI-driven pullback last week and blown intraday rebounds. The tech-led bounce today suggests stabilization, but the theme keeps the tape sensitive, moderating a full-throated risk-on.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Thanksgiving trading schedule is the key operational catalyst: US markets are closed Thursday and end early at 1 p.m. ET on Friday, which typically compresses liquidity and could dampen moves into the next 24 hours. Coverage also notes economic data delays and a broader data vacuum, so the absence of major releases may keep price action contained. No specific earnings or policy events are flagged in the provided feed for the next day.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% – After a strong risk-on session (Nasdaq +2.69%, S&P 500 +1.55%) with a 12.42% drop in VIX and the 10Y at 4.04%, futures are essentially unchanged (ES +0.01%, NQ -0.01%, YM -0.06%, RTY +0.02%) and coverage points to a data vacuum into the holiday, favoring consolidation over follow-through.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the overnight, watch whether the VIX can sustain near or below last week’s 7-day reference of 20.0 versus the current 20.52, and whether the 10Y yield holds around 4.04% after the 1-day decline from 4.06%, as further vol compression and steady rates would support the bid. On index futures, S&P futures around 6,721.75 have nearby markers at the 7-day reference 6,755.25 and 30-day reference 6,686.50; Nasdaq futures near 24,946.50 sit below the 7-day reference 25,094.00, and Russell futures at 2,419.30 have 2,396.00 (7-day reference) and 2,510.70 (30-day reference) as range posts to frame risk. Within equities, monitor whether tech leadership persists (QQQ +2.56% on the day) and if small caps can extend their weekly edge (Russell 2000 +1.31% 7d) against Dow underperformance (-2.13% 7d). Also track crude at 58.68 (-2.35% 7d) and the US Dollar at 100.23 (+0.97% 7d) for cross-asset pressure points that could cap follow-through in a holiday-thinned tape.
