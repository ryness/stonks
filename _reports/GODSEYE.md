  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a tentative risk-on turn: the S&P 500 rose 0.38% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.59%, and the Dow added 0.10%, while small caps lagged with the Russell 2000 down 0.04%. Breadth improved (12 up vs 3 down) and the average index change was +0.34%, pointing to a modest rebound in risk appetite.
  
  Volatility eased but remains elevated, with VIX down 4.17% on the day to 23.66 yet still up 34% over the past week and 45% over 30 days, signaling lingering stress. Rates were a mild headwind, as the 10Y Treasury yield ticked up to 4.13% (+0.24% 1d, +0.56% 7d), and the dollar firmed slightly (+0.05% 1d, +0.83% 7d).
  
  Futures point to stronger follow-through for the next session: S&P futures +1.36%, Nasdaq futures +1.92%, Dow futures +0.68%, and Russell futures +1.02%. Still, the 7-day tape remains risk-off (S&P -2.78%, Nasdaq -4.09%, Russell -4.39%, Dow -2.60%), so the improving tone is tactical rather than decisive.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive near term. Breadth is solid (12 up, 3 down) and the average index gain of 0.34% shows buyers re-engaging. However, volatility remains elevated with VIX at 23.66 and sharply higher over the week, while the 10Y yield at 4.13% has edged up, tempering risk appetite. Net, conditions improved day-over-day but remain fragile versus the past week’s drawdown.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated back to large-cap tech on the day, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.59% and QQQ up 0.60%, while small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 slipped 0.04%. Over the week, small caps are the notable laggard (Russell 2000 -4.39%) versus the Dow’s smaller decline (-2.60%). A positive standout on the day is Nasdaq futures (+1.92% 1d), while a negative standout is the Russell 2000 (-0.04% 1d).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI valuation concerns have weighed on U.S. equities, as highlighted by reports of a slide amid worries about an AI bubble. This has been a risk-off catalyst in recent sessions and aligns with the elevated VIX over the week, though today’s bounce suggests some stabilization as investors reassess positioning. Regionally, India’s markets rebounded on IT strength and hopes for an India–US trade deal, indicating pockets of risk-on sentiment tied to tech and policy optimism. While localized, this constructive tone from IT buying and trade optimism can support broader risk appetite at the margin. Tighter perceived Fed policy and fading near-term rate-cut hopes have stirred volatility, with commentary noting reduced odds of near-term easing. This has contributed to risk-off pressures and is consistent with higher 10Y yields over the week and the VIX’s sharp 7-day rise.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Walmart earnings on Thursday are a key near-term catalyst that can sway retail, consumer sentiment, and inflation read-throughs; a solid print would support risk-on while a miss could pressure cyclicals. U.S. jobs data flagged in coverage remains in focus, with a stronger labor read likely to lift yields and restrain equities while a softer print could ease rate concerns and aid risk assets.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — Strong futures (ES +1.36%, NQ +1.92%, RTY +1.02%) and improved breadth (12 up, 3 down) following a positive day (+0.34% average index gain) suggest follow-through buying, though elevated VIX (23.66, +34% 7d) and higher 10Y yields (4.13%) cap confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures holds and cash confirmation: ES near 6,752, NQ around 25,197, and RTY near 2,379. Sustained Nasdaq leadership should support an up bias; confirmation would include small-cap participation after recent underperformance (RUT -4.39% 7d). Monitor volatility and rates as guardrails: a further pullback in VIX from 23.66 would validate risk-on, while another uptick in the 10Y from 4.13% could blunt the bounce. A firmer dollar (DXY ~100.28) could also pressure cyclicals if it extends higher. Stay alert to consumer read-throughs: Walmart’s Thursday report can move retail and broader discretionary; a positive tone would favor QQQ and SPY follow-through, while disappointment could stall the bid. Also track commodities for confirmation—gold easing (-0.24% 1d) and steady crude (+0.10% 1d) are consistent with a tentative risk-on tape.
