  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities closed mixed with a slightly negative tilt: S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow 30 -0.65% lagging, while the Nasdaq Composite +0.13% and Russell 2000 +0.22% outperformed. Breadth was marginally negative at 7 up vs 8 down and the average index change was -0.05%, pointing to a cautious tone rather than broad risk-taking.
  
  Volatility eased on the day but remains elevated: VIX at 19.83 fell 0.85% today yet is up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over the month, signaling risk appetite has faded on a multi-day basis. Rates firmed with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, a headwind for equities and consistent with cyclical weakness.
  
  Futures reflect the same mixed tone: S&P -0.07%, Nasdaq flat, Dow -0.67%, Russell +0.25% on the day. On a 7-day view, futures are weaker across the board (ES -1.03%, NQ -2.53%, RTY -3.13%), quantifying a deterioration in risk appetite even as today’s session saw selective strength in growth and small caps.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is tentative. Breadth is slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average index move was a small decline of -0.05%, showing no broad-based advance. Volatility remains elevated with VIX at 19.83 up 10.11% over the week, and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15% today, both tempering risk appetite. Overall, conditions look fragile rather than robust despite pockets of intraday resilience.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps today, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%. The Dow 30 was the notable laggard at -0.65% on the day. Over the last week, small caps have led to the downside (Russell 2000 -3.11%) and the Nasdaq has also underperformed (-2.55%), while the Dow has been the relative “leader” by falling the least (-0.35%).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Guarded risk sentiment is tied to tech-led weakness and concerns over China, as reflected in reports that global markets struggled after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy. This aligns with the weekly drawdowns in the Nasdaq (-2.55% 7d) and Russell (-3.11% 7d) and a higher VIX over the week (+10.11%), reinforcing a risk-off bias on a multi-day horizon. Trade policy headlines offered a modest counterweight, with Australia welcoming the removal of tariffs on certain food imports to the US, a de-escalation that supports global trade sentiment at the margin. The day’s cross-asset moves were mixed—oil rose (+2.39% WTI) while gold fell (-2.37%)—consistent with a nuanced rather than uniformly defensive tape. Geopolitical tension in the Middle East, including constraints on Gaza aid, adds a background risk premium. That backdrop is consistent with a still-elevated volatility regime (VIX near 20) even as it eased today, helping explain why risk appetite has not fully recovered despite selective equity strength.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Mixed signals dominate: SPX -0.05% with average index change -0.05% and breadth 7/8, futures are near flat to slightly negative (ES -0.07%, NQ ~0%), VIX eased today but is elevated on a weekly basis, and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15%. News flow points to lingering tech and China concerns offset by minor trade positives, arguing for a range-bound bias over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch macro risk gauges first: the 10Y Treasury yield at 4.15% after a +0.88% daily rise and VIX near 19.8. A sustained move by VIX back above 20 or a further push higher in yields would skew the tape risk-off, while stabilization or retracement in either could allow equities to drift sideways to slightly higher. Track leadership and futures levels for confirmation of tone: ES 6,755, NQ 25,094, YM 47,229, RTY 2,396. Monitor whether the Russell 2000 can build on its +0.25% futures gain and +0.22% cash outperformance, and whether the Dow’s -0.65% lagging pattern persists, as these rotations will shape index-level direction. Keep an eye on Energy and defensives after cross-asset divergences: WTI at 60.09 (+2.39% today) versus Gold at 4,087.6 (-2.37%). Strength in oil alongside a softer gold print and an only slightly firmer dollar (DXY 99.27, +0.09% 1d) fits a neutral-to-mixed risk setting; any sharp reversals here could tip the broader tape away from flat.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-15T13:31:12.634843+00:00">2025-11-15 13:31 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 13s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities closed mixed with a slightly negative tilt: S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow 30 -0.65% lagging, while the Nasdaq Composite +0.13% and Russell 2000 +0.22% outperformed. Breadth was marginally negative at 7 up vs 8 down and the average index change was -0.05%, pointing to a cautious tone rather than broad risk-taking.

Volatility eased on the day but remains elevated: VIX at 19.83 fell 0.85% today yet is up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over the month, signaling risk appetite has faded on a multi-day basis. Rates firmed with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, a headwind for equities and consistent with cyclical weakness.

Futures reflect the same mixed tone: S&P -0.07%, Nasdaq flat, Dow -0.67%, Russell +0.25% on the day. On a 7-day view, futures are weaker across the board (ES -1.03%, NQ -2.53%, RTY -3.13%), quantifying a deterioration in risk appetite even as today’s session saw selective strength in growth and small caps.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is tentative. Breadth is slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average index move was a small decline of -0.05%, showing no broad-based advance. Volatility remains elevated with VIX at 19.83 up 10.11% over the week, and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15% today, both tempering risk appetite. Overall, conditions look fragile rather than robust despite pockets of intraday resilience.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps today, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%. The Dow 30 was the notable laggard at -0.65% on the day. Over the last week, small caps have led to the downside (Russell 2000 -3.11%) and the Nasdaq has also underperformed (-2.55%), while the Dow has been the relative “leader” by falling the least (-0.35%).

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Guarded risk sentiment is tied to tech-led weakness and concerns over China, as reflected in reports that global markets struggled after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy. This aligns with the weekly drawdowns in the Nasdaq (-2.55% 7d) and Russell (-3.11% 7d) and a higher VIX over the week (+10.11%), reinforcing a risk-off bias on a multi-day horizon. Trade policy headlines offered a modest counterweight, with Australia welcoming the removal of tariffs on certain food imports to the US, a de-escalation that supports global trade sentiment at the margin. The day’s cross-asset moves were mixed—oil rose (+2.39% WTI) while gold fell (-2.37%)—consistent with a nuanced rather than uniformly defensive tape. Geopolitical tension in the Middle East, including constraints on Gaza aid, adds a background risk premium. That backdrop is consistent with a still-elevated volatility regime (VIX near 20) even as it eased today, helping explain why risk appetite has not fully recovered despite selective equity strength.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Mixed signals dominate: SPX -0.05% with average index change -0.05% and breadth 7/8, futures are near flat to slightly negative (ES -0.07%, NQ ~0%), VIX eased today but is elevated on a weekly basis, and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15%. News flow points to lingering tech and China concerns offset by minor trade positives, arguing for a range-bound bias over the next 24 hours.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch macro risk gauges first: the 10Y Treasury yield at 4.15% after a +0.88% daily rise and VIX near 19.8. A sustained move by VIX back above 20 or a further push higher in yields would skew the tape risk-off, while stabilization or retracement in either could allow equities to drift sideways to slightly higher. Track leadership and futures levels for confirmation of tone: ES 6,755, NQ 25,094, YM 47,229, RTY 2,396. Monitor whether the Russell 2000 can build on its +0.25% futures gain and +0.22% cash outperformance, and whether the Dow’s -0.65% lagging pattern persists, as these rotations will shape index-level direction. Keep an eye on Energy and defensives after cross-asset divergences: WTI at 60.09 (+2.39% today) versus Gold at 4,087.6 (-2.37%). Strength in oil alongside a softer gold print and an only slightly firmer dollar (DXY 99.27, +0.09% 1d) fits a neutral-to-mixed risk setting; any sharp reversals here could tip the broader tape away from flat.
