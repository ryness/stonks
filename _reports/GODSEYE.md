  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Equities are showing a constructive, risk-on tone in the very near term. All major U.S. benchmarks are up on the day, with the S&P 500 +0.77%, Nasdaq Composite +1.04%, and Russell 2000 +1.20%, and breadth is strong with 14 assets up versus 1 down. That said, the 30-day picture is more mixed, with the Nasdaq still down 3.41% and QQQ off 3.00%, indicating that today's rebound is occurring after a period of tech-led weakness.",
      "Volatility is easing modestly, with the VIX down 0.61% on the day and 5.68% over the week to 19.43, which supports the idea of stabilizing risk appetite after a spike; however, it remains about 28.5% higher than 30 days ago, signaling that the underlying risk premium is still elevated. S&P and Nasdaq futures are incrementally higher (ES +0.19%, NQ +0.26%) and Russell futures are outperforming at +0.44%, while Dow futures lag at +0.17%, suggesting moderate but broad-based risk-on positioning rather than aggressive chasing.",
      "Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive but not euphoric. The 10Y Treasury yield is essentially flat on the day (+0.10%) and has drifted lower over 7 and 30 days (-1.73% and -3.31%), which eases valuation headwinds for equities and aligns with improving risk appetite. At the same time, gold (+0.81% 1d, +12.88% 30d) and WTI crude (+0.17% 1d, +10.49% 30d) are firm, implying that while equity risk appetite is improving in the short term, there remains a strong bid for hedges and real assets consistent with lingering macro uncertainty."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks relatively solid in the short term. Breadth is strong with 14 assets advancing and only 1 declining, and the average 1-day index move is a robust +0.93%, showing broad participation rather than a narrow bounce. The VIX has eased over the last week to 19.43 and the 10Y yield is slightly lower over 7 and 30 days, indicating that both volatility and rate pressures have stabilized versus recent stress. However, the still-elevated VIX versus 30 days ago and recent 30-day drawdowns in large-cap and tech benchmarks suggest the tape is recovering rather than fully healed.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small caps and growth have led, with the Russell 2000 up 1.20% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.04%, mirrored by QQQ's 1.07% gain. The S&P 500 and Dow are positive but more subdued at +0.77% and +0.76%, respectively, and Dow futures are the laggard among futures at +0.17% on the day and -0.50% over the week. On a 7-day basis, the Russell 2000 (+1.40%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.18%) are standouts on the upside, while the Dow 30 (-0.56% 7d) is the primary underperformer, underscoring a rotation away from blue-chip cyclicals toward small caps and tech after recent stress.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "Macro and geopolitical themes around trade policy and tariffs remain central to the tape. Recent news highlights a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Trump's tariffs are illegal and ongoing headlines about Trump doubling down on tariff threats and vowing to do "absolutely terrible things to foreign countries… in a much more powerful and obnoxious way," reinforcing trade-war uncertainty. Earlier, U.S. equities had finished sharply lower on trade uncertainty and AI-disruption fears, a clear risk-off impulse, but the current equity rebound alongside modestly higher futures suggests markets are tentatively fading the worst-case tariff fears for now while still pricing an elevated volatility regime.",
      "AI-related disruption concerns and sector rotations are another visible driver. Prior headlines cited global selloffs in stocks and gold as "AI fear grips markets" and renewed worries over AI's impact on legacy systems, which contributed to sharp declines in some sessions; this previously pushed investors into a risk-off stance. The present leadership from the Nasdaq and QQQ, despite those AI-disruption fears, indicates that tech sentiment is stabilizing, shifting the immediate tone back toward risk-on even as AI remains a medium-term volatility catalyst.",
      "Crypto and recession-related narratives are influencing the broader risk mood at the margin. Articles warning that Bitcoin could crash to $10,000 amid U.S. recession risks, along with commentary that Bitcoin is trading more like a rates product as CPI cools and labor data are revised, reflect lingering concerns about growth and financial conditions. While these crypto-specific stories skew risk-off in tone, the concurrent decline in the 10Y yield over the last month and today's equity bid suggest that, for now, traditional risk assets are leaning more on the supportive rates backdrop than on recession or crypto stress signals."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete market-moving events over the next 24 hours in this dataset are not specified at the level of particular U.S. earnings releases or major economic data prints, so the main identifiable triggers are further developments on U.S. tariff policy and reactions to prior macro speeches such as Fed Governor Waller's recent remarks on labor market data. Additional catalysts could come from ongoing coverage and political responses to the Supreme Court's tariff ruling and Trump's subsequent tariff threats, which have already driven volatility in prior sessions and could again tilt risk sentiment. Any new headlines escalating or de-escalating trade tensions, or fresh interpretations of recent labor and inflation data in follow-on commentary, are therefore likely to be the primary sources of incremental volatility in the coming day.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up. All major U.S. equity benchmarks are positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.77%, Nasdaq +1.04%, Russell 2000 +1.20%), futures are slightly higher across the board (ES +0.19%, NQ +0.26%, RTY +0.44%), and breadth is strong with 14 assets up versus 1 down, indicating improving risk appetite. The VIX is down on the day and week, and the 10Y yield has drifted lower over the past month, providing a more supportive backdrop versus recent stress. While trade and AI-related headlines remain potential headwinds that keep volatility elevated versus 30 days ago, the balance of current price action and macro context in the provided data tilts toward a continuation of the rebound rather than an immediate reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Into the next session, traders should monitor whether the current bounce in tech and small caps can hold, focusing on the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000 along with their futures (NQ and RTY). Sustained strength with the Nasdaq remaining above its recent rebound area around 22,800 and the Russell holding above roughly 2,650–2,660 on cash and futures would confirm the risk-on bias implied by today's moves. Any renewed underperformance of the Dow, which is lagging on a 7-day basis, relative to growth and small caps would signal that the market is still favoring higher-beta exposure on relief from prior macro shocks.",
      "Cross-asset checks will be critical to validating the "up" bias. Watch the VIX around the 19 handle: continued slippage toward or below recent lows would be consistent with further equity gains, whereas a sharp intraday reversal higher would warn of headline risk re-emerging. On the rates side, a stable-to-lower 10Y yield near 4.0% supports valuations; a quick backup higher would challenge the rally. In commodities and FX, persistent strength in gold and crude alongside only a marginally stronger dollar suggests a mix of risk-taking and hedging; an abrupt spike in the dollar or gold could flag a turn back toward risk-off tied to fresh tariff or macro news.",
      "Given the sensitivity of recent sessions to policy and geopolitical headlines, traders should also stay alert to any new statements or developments around U.S. trade policy and tariffs, as prior tariff-related headlines triggered sharp selloffs. If such news remains quiet or leans toward reduced tension, the existing pattern of slightly higher S&P and Nasdaq futures is more likely to carry through into the next cash session. Conversely, a sudden escalation in trade rhetoric or AI-disruption concerns similar to those cited in earlier selloffs could quickly undermine the current rebound and would be the primary factor that could invalidate the base-case upward bias."

    "Equities are showing a constructive, risk-on tone in the very near term. All major U.S. benchmarks are up on the day, with the S&P 500 +0.77%, Nasdaq Composite +1.04%, and Russell 2000 +1.20%, and breadth is strong with 14 assets up versus 1 down.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks relatively solid in the short term. Breadth is strong with 14 assets advancing and only 1 declining, and the average 1-day index move is a robust +0.93%, showing broad participation rather than a narrow bounce. The VIX has eased over the last week to 19.43 and the 10Y yield is slightly lower over 7 and 30 days, indicating that both volatility and rate pressures have stabilized versus recent stress. However, the still-elevated VIX versus 30 days ago and recent 30-day drawdowns in large-cap and tech benchmarks suggest the tape is recovering rather than fully healed.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small caps and growth have led, with the Russell 2000 up 1.20% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.04%, mirrored by QQQ's 1.07% gain. The S&P 500 and Dow are positive but more subdued at +0.77% and +0.76%, respectively, and Dow futures are the laggard among futures at +0.17% on the day and -0.50% over the week. On a 7-day basis, the Russell 2000 (+1.40%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.18%) are standouts on the upside, while the Dow 30 (-0.56% 7d) is the primary underperformer, underscoring a rotation away from blue-chip cyclicals toward small caps and tech after recent stress.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** [
    "Macro and geopolitical themes around trade policy and tariffs remain central to the tape. Recent news highlights a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Trump's tariffs are illegal and ongoing headlines about Trump doubling down on tariff threats and vowing to do "absolutely terrible things to foreign countries… in a much more powerful and obnoxious way," reinforcing trade-war uncertainty.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up. All major U.S. equity benchmarks are positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.77%, Nasdaq +1.04%, Russell 2000 +1.20%), futures are slightly higher across the board (ES +0.19%, NQ +0.26%, RTY +0.44%), and breadth is strong with 14 assets up versus 1 down, indicating improving risk appetite.
