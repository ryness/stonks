  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a mixed-to-soft tone with risk appetite fading at the margin: S&P 500 fell 0.23% on the day, Nasdaq Composite slid 0.71%, and Russell 2000 lost 0.34%, while the Dow 30 outperformed with a 0.45% gain. Breadth leaned negative (6 up vs 9 down) and the average index change was -0.30%, signaling a modest risk-off skew.
  
  Volatility firmed and futures echo the same split, reinforcing caution. VIX edged up 0.62% to 17.71 on the day and is up 8.78% over 30 days, while S&P futures dipped 0.22%, Nasdaq futures dropped 0.69%, and Dow futures rose 0.46%; Russell futures declined 0.30%. Rates were slightly higher with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.24% to 4.12%, a mild headwind to duration-sensitive growth.
  
  Despite the near-term wobble, medium-term tone remains constructive with 30-day gains still intact across majors (S&P 500 +1.92%, Nasdaq +3.09%). That said, the combination of tech-led weakness, firmer VIX, and soft index futures suggests risk appetite is cooling in the very near term.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mildly deteriorating short term. Breadth was negative (6 up vs 9 down) and the average index change across benchmarks was -0.30% on the day, indicating sellers had the edge. Volatility is edging higher with VIX at 17.71 (+0.62% 1d), while the 10Y yield ticked up to 4.12% (+0.24% 1d), a backdrop that typically softens risk appetite. Overall, the setup looks cautious but not disorderly given still-positive 30-day returns.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to value/industrials with the Dow 30 the standout gainer at +0.45% 1d, mirrored by Dow futures at +0.46% 1d. On the lagging side, tech bore the brunt as QQQ fell 0.73% 1d and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.71% 1d; Nasdaq futures were down 0.69% 1d. Over the last week, the Dow 30 is roughly flat (+0.04%), outperforming the Nasdaq Composite (-1.54%) and Russell 2000 (-1.30%).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Tech shares slid amid headlines that SoftBank sold an Nvidia stake, pressuring growth leaders and skewing risk-off in the near term as evidenced by QQQ (-0.73% 1d) and Nasdaq futures (-0.69% 1d). This narrows leadership and raises index fragility given mega-cap concentration, aligning with the day’s uptick in VIX. Political tape risk remains in focus with the US House set to consider a stopgap funding bill to end the shutdown, where a pass would be risk-on (reducing tail risk) while delays could extend risk-off. Indian market commentary highlights optimism tied to US shutdown resolution prospects and foreign inflows, indicating global sentiment sensitivity to this policy path. UK macro signals were mixed, with commentary around a potential December rate cut and rising unemployment, which can be interpreted as near-term growth concern (risk-off) but also eventual policy support (risk-on) if easing materializes. The net read contributes to a cautious global tone rather than a decisive bid for risk today.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** US House consideration of a stopgap funding bill to end the government shutdown (risk-on if it passes, risk-off if it stalls); ongoing India Q2 corporate results and IPO activity flagged in local market coverage (potentially supportive for regional risk sentiment); no other specific data releases or policy events are identified in the provided sources for the next 24 hours.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% - Tech-led weakness (Nasdaq Composite -0.71%, QQQ -0.73%), negative breadth (6 up vs 9 down), a firmer VIX (+0.62% to 17.71), and softer ES/NQ futures (-0.22%/-0.69%) point to a cautious, downside-biased tape over the next day; a binary upside risk is a clean House pass of the stopgap funding bill.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures for confirmation of direction: S&P futures near 6,841.75 and Nasdaq futures around 25,536.75 need to stabilize or reclaim prior levels to blunt the downside; sustained pressure below these marks would validate the bearish bias. Keep an eye on VIX holding above ~17.7 as a tell for persistent hedging demand. Focus on mega-cap tech leadership via QQQ and the Nasdaq Composite given their 1d underperformance and sensitivity to the Nvidia/SoftBank headline. Also monitor whether Dow futures’ relative strength (+0.46% 1d) persists, which would signal continued rotation into value/industrials rather than broad risk-on. Track policy and macro barometers that could swing sentiment: headlines on the US House stopgap funding bill, the 10Y yield near 4.12% for rate-pressure cues, and cross-asset risk hedges with Gold at 4,118.50 and the US Dollar at 99.35 (-0.27% 1d). A decisive funding resolution would likely compress the VIX and stabilize equities; absent that, watch for further tech-led downside.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-11T16:30:12.258846+00:00">2025-11-11 16:30 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 44s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities show a mixed-to-soft tone with risk appetite fading at the margin: S&P 500 fell 0.23% on the day, Nasdaq Composite slid 0.71%, and Russell 2000 lost 0.34%, while the Dow 30 outperformed with a 0.45% gain. Breadth leaned negative (6 up vs 9 down) and the average index change was -0.30%, signaling a modest risk-off skew.

Volatility firmed and futures echo the same split, reinforcing caution. VIX edged up 0.62% to 17.71 on the day and is up 8.78% over 30 days, while S&P futures dipped 0.22%, Nasdaq futures dropped 0.69%, and Dow futures rose 0.46%; Russell futures declined 0.30%. Rates were slightly higher with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.24% to 4.12%, a mild headwind to duration-sensitive growth.

Despite the near-term wobble, medium-term tone remains constructive with 30-day gains still intact across majors (S&P 500 +1.92%, Nasdaq +3.09%). That said, the combination of tech-led weakness, firmer VIX, and soft index futures suggests risk appetite is cooling in the very near term.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mildly deteriorating short term. Breadth was negative (6 up vs 9 down) and the average index change across benchmarks was -0.30% on the day, indicating sellers had the edge. Volatility is edging higher with VIX at 17.71 (+0.62% 1d), while the 10Y yield ticked up to 4.12% (+0.24% 1d), a backdrop that typically softens risk appetite. Overall, the setup looks cautious but not disorderly given still-positive 30-day returns.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to value/industrials with the Dow 30 the standout gainer at +0.45% 1d, mirrored by Dow futures at +0.46% 1d. On the lagging side, tech bore the brunt as QQQ fell 0.73% 1d and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.71% 1d; Nasdaq futures were down 0.69% 1d. Over the last week, the Dow 30 is roughly flat (+0.04%), outperforming the Nasdaq Composite (-1.54%) and Russell 2000 (-1.30%).

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Tech shares slid amid headlines that SoftBank sold an Nvidia stake, pressuring growth leaders and skewing risk-off in the near term as evidenced by QQQ (-0.73% 1d) and Nasdaq futures (-0.69% 1d). This narrows leadership and raises index fragility given mega-cap concentration, aligning with the day’s uptick in VIX. Political tape risk remains in focus with the US House set to consider a stopgap funding bill to end the shutdown, where a pass would be risk-on (reducing tail risk) while delays could extend risk-off. Indian market commentary highlights optimism tied to US shutdown resolution prospects and foreign inflows, indicating global sentiment sensitivity to this policy path. UK macro signals were mixed, with commentary around a potential December rate cut and rising unemployment, which can be interpreted as near-term growth concern (risk-off) but also eventual policy support (risk-on) if easing materializes. The net read contributes to a cautious global tone rather than a decisive bid for risk today.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** US House consideration of a stopgap funding bill to end the government shutdown (risk-on if it passes, risk-off if it stalls); ongoing India Q2 corporate results and IPO activity flagged in local market coverage (potentially supportive for regional risk sentiment); no other specific data releases or policy events are identified in the provided sources for the next 24 hours.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% - Tech-led weakness (Nasdaq Composite -0.71%, QQQ -0.73%), negative breadth (6 up vs 9 down), a firmer VIX (+0.62% to 17.71), and softer ES/NQ futures (-0.22%/-0.69%) point to a cautious, downside-biased tape over the next day; a binary upside risk is a clean House pass of the stopgap funding bill.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures for confirmation of direction: S&P futures near 6,841.75 and Nasdaq futures around 25,536.75 need to stabilize or reclaim prior levels to blunt the downside; sustained pressure below these marks would validate the bearish bias. Keep an eye on VIX holding above ~17.7 as a tell for persistent hedging demand. Focus on mega-cap tech leadership via QQQ and the Nasdaq Composite given their 1d underperformance and sensitivity to the Nvidia/SoftBank headline. Also monitor whether Dow futures’ relative strength (+0.46% 1d) persists, which would signal continued rotation into value/industrials rather than broad risk-on. Track policy and macro barometers that could swing sentiment: headlines on the US House stopgap funding bill, the 10Y yield near 4.12% for rate-pressure cues, and cross-asset risk hedges with Gold at 4,118.50 and the US Dollar at 99.35 (-0.27% 1d). A decisive funding resolution would likely compress the VIX and stabilize equities; absent that, watch for further tech-led downside.
