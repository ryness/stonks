  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-21T01:28:41.084153+00:00">2025-11-21 01:28 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 17s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite faded across equities with broad declines: S&P 500 -1.56% day-over-day, Nasdaq Composite -2.15%, Russell 2000 -1.82%, and Dow -0.84%. On a 7-day basis the drawdowns are deeper (S&P 500 -4.50%, Nasdaq -5.92%, Russell -6.23%), underscoring a risk-off tone.
  
  Volatility surged, with VIX up 11.67% on the day and 52.89% over the week to 26.42, signaling heightened hedging and stress. Elevated vol alongside falling equities quantifies a deterioration in risk appetite.
  
  Futures remained soft into the latest snapshot: S&P futures -1.19%, Nasdaq futures -2.09%, Dow futures -0.43%, and Russell futures -1.49% on the day. Rates leaned supportive at the margin (10Y Treasury yield -0.65% to 4.11), while oil weakened (WTI -1.51% day-over-day), consistent with a defensive, growth-wary setup.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak. Breadth shows 1 up versus 14 down and the average index change is -1.71% on the day, indicating broad-based selling rather than isolated pockets of weakness. Volatility is elevated with VIX at 26.42 (+52.89% over the week), while the 10Y Treasury yield easing to 4.11% (-0.65% day-over-day) points to a mild safety bid in rates. The combination of poor breadth, negative averages, and high vol suggests a stressed tape.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed defensive on a relative basis: the Dow was the best of the majors at -0.84% day-over-day, while growth proxies lagged with QQQ -2.37% and the Nasdaq Composite -2.15%. A clear positive standout on the day was the VIX, up 11.67% (a risk-off signal). Over the week, small caps remain the weakest with the Russell 2000 -6.23%, versus the S&P 500 -4.50%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI and megacap tech remain the focal macro theme, with headlines noting Nvidia’s earnings beat and guidance lifting sentiment in Asia and pointing to a potential rebound in US futures. This catalyst is risk-on for semiconductors and broader tech, potentially tempering the recent de-risking if follow-through materializes. Countering that, broader narratives highlight a spike in volatility and fading hopes for imminent Fed rate cuts, with Fortune citing a “wrong-way” mix of developments and the VIX jumping. That backdrop, alongside a tech-led selloff noted in multiple wrap pieces, supports a risk-off bias beyond single-stock positives. Oil’s 1.51% daily drop and 4.83% 30-day slide add a growth-caution tone.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** US jobs data highlighted as “on deck” in multiple reports is the primary near-term trigger, with labor prints likely to influence rate-cut expectations and risk sentiment. Follow-through trading on Nvidia’s results is another key driver, especially for semiconductors and broader tech leadership. Asia’s session reaction to these catalysts could shape overnight futures and set the tone into the US open.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Given broad equity declines (S&P 500 -1.56%, Nasdaq -2.15%) and a sharply higher VIX (26.42, +11.67% day-over-day), the backdrop is risk-off, but headlines around Nvidia’s beat suggest a potential countertrend bid. With futures still lower in the latest snapshot (NQ -2.09%, ES -1.19%) and jobs data looming, cross-currents argue for a net flat bias over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech leadership and semiconductors for confirmation or rejection of the Nvidia-led relief: Nasdaq futures near 24,204 with 24,721 (prior 1-day reference) as a pivot to monitor, and S&P futures at 6,582 versus 6,661 prior reference. If VIX holds above 25 (last 26.42), rallies may fade; a decisive move lower in VIX would support stabilization. Track small caps and cyclicals for breadth: Russell futures at 2,319.8 with 2,354.9 as reference, and energy sensitivity to WTI at 58.54 (pressure persists if crude stays below the prior 59.44 reference). In rates, the 10Y yield at 4.11% is a key risk barometer—further downside in yields with weak equities would signal ongoing de-risking, while a stable 4.1% area with calmer vol would align with a flat-to-stabilizing tape.
