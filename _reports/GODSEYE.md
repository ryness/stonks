  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities closed with a distinctly risk-off tone, led by growth and tech weakness: the S&P 500 fell 1.16%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.81%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.07%, while the Dow was relatively resilient at -0.47%. Over the past week, the Nasdaq is down 3.62% and QQQ is off 3.82%, confirming sustained pressure on tech and AI-linked leadership, even as the Dow is modestly higher by 0.31% over 7d and 1.70% over 30d. On average, benchmark indices fell about 1.25% on the day, pointing to fading risk appetite in the cash session.","Volatility and cross-asset signals corroborate this defensive shift, with the VIX up 6.92% on the day and 14.34% over the week to 17.62, while the 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat on the day (+0.05%) and slightly lower over 7d (-0.50%), suggesting demand for safety without a major rates shock. At the same time, gold is sharply higher over 7d (+3.79%) and 30d (+9.69%), and crude is lower over those windows, a combination that typically reflects hedging and slower-growth concerns rather than outright inflation fears. Risk appetite is therefore clearly weaker than a week ago but not in full capitulation, with stress concentrated in high-beta growth.","Futures, however, show some tentative stabilization after the selloff: S&P futures are up 0.91%, Nasdaq futures +1.30%, Dow futures +0.62%, and Russell futures +0.87% versus their prior marks, suggesting dip-buying interest into the next session. Even so, 7d moves in futures remain negative for S&P (-0.88%) and Nasdaq (-2.76%), indicating that the overnight strength is so far just a partial retracement within a broader pullback. Overall, risk appetite is attempting to improve on a very short-term basis via futures, but the dominant tone across the last week remains one of de-risking, especially in tech and small caps.",""]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mixed but tilting cautious. Breadth across the tracked set is slightly positive (9 up, 6 down), yet the average index change of -1.24% on the day shows that the largest benchmarks are under meaningful pressure despite more assets being green than red. Elevated and rising volatility (VIX up 6.92% on the day and 14.34% over the week) points to a more fragile backdrop. The 10Y Treasury yield holding near 4.15% with only a 0.05% daily move and a small 0.50% weekly decline suggests rates are not the immediate source of stress, but the equity tape is digesting a rotation away from recent leaders, leaving overall market health as cautiously negative rather than outright stressed.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day clearly favors more defensive or value-tilted benchmarks and futures relative to growth: the Dow 30 is the best-performing major U.S. index at -0.47% versus the Nasdaq Composite at -1.81% and QQQ at -1.85%. Over the past week, Dow futures are a standout on the positive side, up 1.25%, while Nasdaq futures lag with a 2.76% decline. On the downside, QQQ's -1.85% 1d move and -3.82% 7d slide make large-cap tech the notable laggard, whereas Dow futures' +0.62% 1d gain into the next session highlights relative leadership in industrials and value-oriented names.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical drivers are centered on policy uncertainty, jobs data, and trade tensions. Multiple headlines point to investors digesting U.S. jobs data that offered mixed signals, which has kept interest rate expectations largely unchanged while still making markets sensitive to each incremental data point. This contributes to a cautious risk stance, as seen in weaker U.S. equities and higher VIX, but without a sharp move in the 10Y yield, implying a moderate risk-off tilt rather than a panic tied to a sudden shift in Fed expectations.","Geopolitical and regulatory headlines are also weighing on sentiment, especially for tech and global cyclicals. The Trump administration's warning about "discriminatory" EU actions against U.S. Big Tech introduces a fresh overhang for large tech platforms, aligning with the notable underperformance in the Nasdaq Composite (-1.81% 1d, -3.62% 7d) and QQQ (-1.85% 1d). Separately, uncertainty around trade deals, such as U.S.–India trade tensions described in recent Sensex/Nifty coverage, and muted global equity performance as investors eye peace negotiations and economic data, together support a risk-off bias and rotation away from high-multiple growth toward more defensive assets like gold, which is up 3.79% over 7d and 9.69% over 30d.","Crypto-specific news indicates a more idiosyncratic risk environment, with articles highlighting Bitcoin volatility around the FOMC meeting and range-bound expectations, plus institutional positioning themes into 2026. While these developments are largely confined to digital assets, the discussion of "fading risk appetite" in Bitcoin near $86,000 and ETF outflows echoes the broader de-risking seen in equities. This parallel suggests that across multiple risk assets, investors are trimming exposure rather than aggressively adding, reinforcing a cautious global risk tone."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets are likely to focus on additional U.S. economic data and any follow-up commentary related to recent jobs releases, as several articles emphasize that investors are "positioning for a busy week of data" and watching jobs and inflation for rate clues. Any new Fed-related commentary or hints around the timing and magnitude of future rate cuts, referenced in coverage of Wall Street weighing "odds of rate cuts," could move both equities and Treasuries. Globally, updates on U.S.–EU tensions over Big Tech regulation and ongoing trade-deal uncertainty, particularly between the U.S. and key partners like India, may also impact risk sentiment, with negative headlines likely to pressure tech and cyclicals and supportive developments potentially easing some of the current risk-off bias.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The most likely direction for the next 24 hours is flat, with a modestly balanced risk profile. Cash equities just posted broad declines (S&P 500 -1.16%, Nasdaq -1.81%, Russell 2000 -1.07%) and higher volatility (VIX +6.92%), signaling de-risking, but index futures are meaningfully higher (S&P +0.91%, Nasdaq +1.30%, Russell +0.87%), indicating active dip-buying interest overnight. The 10Y yield is stable and recent news flow centers on digesting existing jobs data and policy uncertainty rather than a fresh shock, which argues against a decisive trend move. Taken together, the pull between short-term rebound buying in futures and the still-negative 7d trend, especially in tech, points to a choppy, range-bound session rather than a clear directional break.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should focus on whether futures strength in the S&P (up 0.91% overnight) and Nasdaq (up 1.30%) can hold through the cash open and reclaim key psychological levels implied by recent closes, such as stabilizing the S&P 500 above its prior 6,721.43 cash close and preventing further deterioration in the Nasdaq from its 22,693.32 level. Watch the behavior of the VIX around 17–18: continued moderation from its 17.62 last close after a 6.92% spike would support the flat, range-bound scenario, while another sharp rise would signal renewed downside pressure despite firmer futures. In Treasuries, the 10Y yield holding near 4.15% with little day-to-day movement remains a key confirmation that rate fears are contained; any abrupt move away from this anchor could quickly shift the equity bias.","Sector-wise, monitoring tech and growth proxies is critical, given QQQ's outsized 1d loss of 1.85% and 7d slide of 3.82% versus the Dow's milder moves; if QQQ cannot participate in the futures-led bounce, leadership may remain narrow and fragile. Traders should also keep an eye on gold, which is up almost 10% over 30 days, as persistent strength there alongside weak equities may signal ongoing hedging and cap equity upside. Finally, global headlines around U.S.–EU Big Tech tensions and trade-deal uncertainty, as well as any incremental jobs or inflation commentary referenced in recent "busy week of data" coverage, should be watched closely for shifts in risk tone that could break markets out of a flat, choppy range."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equities closed with a distinctly risk-off tone, led by growth and tech weakness: the S&P 500 fell 1.16%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.81%, and the Russell 2000 lost 1.07%, while the Dow was relatively resilient at -0.47%. Over the past week, the Nasdaq is down 3.62% and QQQ is off 3.82%, confirming sustained pressure on tech and AI-linked leadership, even as the Dow is modestly higher by 0.31% over 7d and 1.70% over 30d. On average, benchmark indices fell about 1.25% on the day, pointing to fading risk appetite in the cash session.","Volatility and cross-asset signals corroborate this defensive shift, with the VIX up 6.92% on the day and 14.34% over the week to 17.62, while the 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat on the day (+0.05%) and slightly lower over 7d (-0.50%), suggesting demand for safety without a major rates shock.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mixed but tilting cautious. Breadth across the tracked set is slightly positive (9 up, 6 down), yet the average index change of -1.24% on the day shows that the largest benchmarks are under meaningful pressure despite more assets being green than red. Elevated and rising volatility (VIX up 6.92% on the day and 14.34% over the week) points to a more fragile backdrop. The 10Y Treasury yield holding near 4.15% with only a 0.05% daily move and a small 0.50% weekly decline suggests rates are not the immediate source of stress, but the equity tape is digesting a rotation away from recent leaders, leaving overall market health as cautiously negative rather than outright stressed.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day clearly favors more defensive or value-tilted benchmarks and futures relative to growth: the Dow 30 is the best-performing major U.S. index at -0.47% versus the Nasdaq Composite at -1.81% and QQQ at -1.85%. Over the past week, Dow futures are a standout on the positive side, up 1.25%, while Nasdaq futures lag with a 2.76% decline. On the downside, QQQ's -1.85% 1d move and -3.82% 7d slide make large-cap tech the notable laggard, whereas Dow futures' +0.62% 1d gain into the next session highlights relative leadership in industrials and value-oriented names.

## 2. Drivers

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The most likely direction for the next 24 hours is flat, with a modestly balanced risk profile. Cash equities just posted broad declines (S&P 500 -1.16%, Nasdaq -1.81%, Russell 2000 -1.07%) and higher volatility (VIX +6.92%), signaling de-risking, but index futures are meaningfully higher (S&P +0.91%, Nasdaq +1.30%, Russell +0.87%), indicating active dip-buying interest overnight. The 10Y yield is stable and recent news flow centers on digesting existing jobs data and policy uncertainty rather than a fresh shock, which argues against a decisive trend move. Taken together, the pull between short-term rebound buying in futures and the still-negative 7d trend, especially in tech, points to a choppy, range-bound session rather than a clear directional break.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should focus on whether futures strength in the S&P (up 0.91% overnight) and Nasdaq (up 1.30%) can hold through the cash open and reclaim key psychological levels implied by recent closes, such as stabilizing the S&P 500 above its prior 6,721.43 cash close and preventing further deterioration in the Nasdaq from its 22,693.32 level.

In Treasuries, the 10Y yield holding near 4.15% with little day-to-day movement remains a key confirmation that rate fears are contained; any abrupt move away from this anchor could quickly shift the equity bias.","Sector-wise, monitoring tech and growth proxies is critical, given QQQ's outsized 1d loss of 1.85% and 7d slide of 3.82% versus the Dow's milder moves; if QQQ cannot participate in the futures-led bounce, leadership may remain narrow and fragile. Traders should also keep an eye on gold, which is up almost 10% over 30 days, as persistent strength there alongside weak equities may signal ongoing hedging and cap equity upside. Finally, global headlines around U.S.–EU Big Tech tensions and trade-deal uncertainty, as well as any incremental jobs or inflation commentary referenced in recent "busy week of data" coverage, should be watched closely for shifts in risk tone that could break markets out of a flat, choppy range."]
