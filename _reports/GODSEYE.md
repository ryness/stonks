  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad rebound with the S&P 500 up 0.98%, Dow 1.08%, Nasdaq 0.88%, and Russell 2000 2.80%, indicating improving risk appetite on the day after a tough week. Breadth skewed positive (10 up, 4 down, 1 flat) and the average 1-day index change across benchmarks was 1.25%, reinforcing a risk-on tone.
  
  Volatility eased but remains elevated: the VIX fell 11.32% on the day to 23.43, yet is still up 33.81% over the week, signaling that risk appetite is mending but fragile. Rates supported the bounce with the 10Y Treasury yield down 1.05% on the day to 4.06, modestly easing financial conditions.
  
  Futures point to cautious follow-through with S&P +0.55%, Nasdaq +0.79%, Dow +0.25%, and Russell +0.53%. However, the 7-day performance remains negative across major indices (e.g., S&P -3.62%, Nasdaq -4.84%, Dow -4.16%, Russell -3.31%), quantifying that while near-term sentiment improved, broader risk appetite has faded week-over-week.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks tentatively constructive on a 1-day basis, with breadth at 10 up, 4 down, and 1 flat and an average index gain of 1.25%. The VIX dropped 11.32% to 23.43, but its 7-day jump of 33.81% keeps overall volatility elevated. The 10Y Treasury yield eased 1.05% to 4.06, offering some support to equity multiples. Net-net, conditions are stabilizing but not yet robust given the still-high volatility backdrop and recent weekly drawdowns.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 2.80% on the day, outpacing the S&P 500 (+0.98%) and Nasdaq (+0.88%), while QQQ lagged within the green at +0.75%. On the week, the Nasdaq Composite (-4.84%) and QQQ (-4.99%) are notable laggards, whereas the Russell 2000 (-3.31%) and Russell futures (-0.08%) comparatively outperformed. A negative standout on the day was Gold futures at -0.91%, contrasting with the risk-on equity tone.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fed commentary helped steady risk sentiment into the Friday bounce, with Investopedia noting that remarks from a Federal Reserve official boosted confidence in the likelihood of an interest rate cut, which is typically risk-on for equities and rate-sensitive segments. This aligns with the 10Y yield slipping 1.05% to 4.06% and the broad 1-day equity gains. At the same time, AI and crypto headlines have been sources of crosscurrents. MarketWatch and Fortune highlighted that doubts around the AI trade and broader risk assets contributed to sharp selloffs earlier in the week, a risk-off impulse that aligns with the VIX still 33.81% higher over 7 days. CoinDesk and other coverage of crypto weakness underscore a fragile risk backdrop, even as equities recovered late in the week. Yahoo’s recap framed the week as turbulent despite the Friday bounce, consistent with negative 7-day returns across the S&P 500 (-3.62%), Dow (-4.16%), and Nasdaq (-4.84%). The mixed news flow leaves the tape sensitive to shifts in policy expectations and mega-cap tech sentiment, with day-to-day moves toggling between risk-on rebounds and risk-off reversals.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 62%: Equity futures are higher (ES +0.55%, NQ +0.79%, RTY +0.53%), the VIX fell 11.32% on the day to 23.43, and the 10Y yield eased 1.05% to 4.06, supporting a modest risk-on follow-through. While 7-day returns remain negative and the VIX is still elevated week-over-week, the immediate setup tilts to a rebound extension.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P 500 futures around 6,620 as a nearby pivot versus the 6,656.75 last; holding above that area would support the constructive bias. Monitor the VIX near 23–24; continued slippage from 23.43 would validate risk-on, while a rebound toward the prior 26.42 reference would warn of risk-off pressure returning. Focus on small caps and growth proxies: the Russell 2000 led with a 2.80% 1-day gain and Russell futures sit at 2,388.00; sustained leadership there would corroborate improving breadth. Also track Nasdaq futures at 24,498.50 versus the 24,305.50 prior reference; maintaining that cushion would help the broader tape. Keep an eye on the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.06; further easing would aid equities, while a snap-back could cap the bounce. Dollar (100.14, 1d -0.04%) and Gold (-0.91% on the day) moves can serve as confirmation signals: a steady dollar and soft haven bid would align with the predicted risk-on tone.
