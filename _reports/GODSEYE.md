  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities ended mixed but steadier: the S&P 500 rose 0.13% and the Dow gained 0.16% while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21%; small caps outperformed with the Russell 2000 up 0.58%. Breadth leaned constructive (9 up, 5 down, 1 flat) and the average index change was a muted +0.07%, signaling a tentative risk-on bias on the day.
  
  Volatility eased on the session with VIX down 2.15% to 19.08, but remains elevated on a 7-day (+12.77%) and 30-day (+24.79%) basis, underscoring lingering risk aversion. Futures show the same bifurcation: S&P (+0.09%) and Dow (+0.12%) were modestly firmer, Russell (+0.54%) led, while Nasdaq futures (-0.31%) lagged.
  
  Rates were stable with the 10Y Treasury unchanged on the day at 4.09% (up 0.86% over 7 days, down 2.25% over 30). The U.S. dollar dipped 0.13% while gold rose 0.49% and WTI crude gained 0.54% on the day, a mixed macro backdrop that supports a cautious but not aggressive risk tone. On balance, risk appetite improved slightly intraday but is still fading on the week given index declines of 1.35%–3.98% and a higher weekly VIX.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is only modestly positive. Breadth favored advancers (9 up vs 5 down, 1 flat) and the average index change was a small +0.07%, pointing to a mild rebound rather than a strong thrust. VIX at 19.08 fell 2.15% today but remains up 12.77% over the week, and the 10Y yield held at 4.09% (up 0.86% over 7 days), both consistent with a still-cautious tape. Overall, conditions look fragile but stabilizing rather than robust.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to small caps today, with the Russell 2000 up 0.58%, while large-cap tech lagged as QQQ fell 0.32% and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.21%. Over the last week, the Dow was the relative leader at -1.35% versus the Nasdaq’s -3.98% and Nasdaq futures’ -4.17%, marking tech as the clear laggard.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Weak U.S. consumer sentiment is a prominent macro drag, with reports noting sentiment near record lows as a government shutdown persists. Combined with deteriorating jobs data cited in headlines, this has added a risk-off impulse earlier in the week and aligns with the VIX’s 7-day rise of 12.77%, even as markets trimmed losses into the close. Tech-specific pressures are another key theme: coverage highlighted an AI chip export ban to China weighing on Nvidia and a broader global chip selloff tied to valuation concerns. That backdrop maps cleanly to the Nasdaq’s 7-day decline of 3.98% and Nasdaq futures down 4.17% over the week, reinforcing risk-off in growth/tech despite today’s modest stabilization elsewhere. Market commentary also emphasized valuation caution and correction risk, which helps explain the defensive bid in gold (+5.94% over 30 days) and the still-elevated VIX on a monthly horizon (+24.79%). These narratives have curtailed risk appetite at the weekly horizon even as today’s tape showed a mild bounce in cyclicals and small caps.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. consumer sentiment/confidence data over the next 24 hours and scheduled Federal Reserve speak are the primary catalysts flagged in the headlines; a weaker confidence print would likely sustain risk-off in tech and keep VIX bid, while a firmer read or benign Fed tone could support a further bounce in broad indices.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed signals argue for a range-bound session: breadth was positive and small caps led today (RUT +0.58%) with VIX down 2.15%, but weekly damage persists (Nasdaq -3.98%, VIX +12.77%) and NQ futures remain soft (-0.31% 1d). With the 10Y steady at 4.09% and consumer sentiment/Fed speak ahead, chop around current levels is the base case.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index and futures handles for follow-through or failure: S&P 500 at 6,728.8 alongside ES at 6,753.75; Nasdaq Composite at 23,004.54 versus NQ at 25,166.25 (monitor whether NQ can reclaim its prior 1-day reference of 25,244.25); and Russell futures at 2,440.60 after leading on the day (+0.54%). A VIX near 19.08 that stays below its prior 1-day reference of 19.50 would align with further stabilization. Sector focus stays on semiconductors and mega-cap tech given the AI export and valuation narrative, consistent with QQQ (-0.32% 1d) and NQ (-0.31% 1d) underperformance. If small caps continue to lead (RUT +0.58% 1d), watch for rotation into cyclicals versus any renewed tech drawdown that drags the broader tape. Into the data, track the 10Y yield at 4.09% for any shift post consumer sentiment/Fed speak; a move higher on the week (+0.86%) has coincided with tech underperformance. Keep an eye on the dollar at 99.60, gold at 3,999.40, and WTI at 59.75 for confirmation of risk appetite—gold strength and a soft dollar alongside steady vol would support a flat-to-firmer equity tone, while renewed vol strength would argue the opposite.
