  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities are trading with a distinctly risk-on tone, with all major U.S. benchmarks up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–6.5% over the week. The S&P 500 gained 0.54% (7d +3.50%), the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.65% (7d +4.16%), and small-cap Russell 2000 is the standout on a weekly basis at +6.46%, signaling broadening participation. QQQ outperformed on the day at +0.81%, confirming solid appetite for growth and tech exposure.
  
  Volatility and futures reinforce the improving risk appetite. The VIX dropped another 4.9% on the day and is down roughly 34–35% over both 7 and 30 days to 16.35, indicating investors are pricing in a calmer backdrop despite the equity strength. Equity futures are even more constructive than cash indices, with S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures all up about 2–2.6% on the day and Russell futures up 3.57%, suggesting traders are leaning into upside momentum into the next session.
  
  Rates and cross-asset moves are broadly supportive rather than restrictive. The 10-year Treasury yield is little changed on the day (+0.48% to 4.02%) and modestly lower over the week (-2.57%), which eases pressure on valuations and complements the equity rally. A slightly softer U.S. dollar (DXY -0.14% on the day, marginally lower on the week) and firmer gold (+3.09% on the day, +3.20% on the week) show some hedging demand, but overall the multi-asset picture points to an improving risk appetite rather than a flight to safety.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong-to-constructive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive with 12 instruments up versus only 3 down, and the average index-level gain of roughly 0.62% on the day points to a broad advance rather than a narrow mega-cap squeeze. Volatility is resetting sharply lower, with VIX down nearly 34% over the week to 16.35, signaling reduced stress. In rates, the 10-year Treasury yield is slightly higher on the day but lower over the week, which, together with softer VIX, supports the view of a generally healthy risk backdrop rather than a late-cycle blow-off.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day and week is coming from small caps and tech, while energy lags. On the day, QQQ is a positive standout at +0.81% and the Nasdaq Composite at +0.65%, while the Russell 2000 also performs well at +0.58% and its futures gain 3.57%. Over the week, the Russell 2000 leads with a 6.46% gain, outpacing the S&P 500 (+3.50%) and Dow (+3.52%), underscoring a rotation into higher beta. On the negative side, WTI crude is a clear laggard at -0.49% on the day and -2.56% on the week, and the U.S. dollar is slightly lower on the day (-0.14%), both underperforming the risk asset complex.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and policy expectations appear to be a key driver of the tape, with multiple headlines referencing Fed rate cut hopes and a softer macro backdrop. News flow highlights “weaker job growth and lower inflation” and growing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December, which typically supports risk-on behavior by lowering discount rates and improving liquidity perceptions. This is consistent with the combination of rising equities, a sharply lower VIX, and a modest weekly decline in 10-year yields, all of which point to investors embracing a more dovish policy narrative. Holiday-thinned global trading and recent volatility events in futures infrastructure are also shaping short-term flows. Reports of mixed world shares with tech consolidating after a rebound, alongside a CME Group outage that temporarily halted futures and Treasuries trading, suggest some mechanical and liquidity-related volatility around an otherwise constructive trend. As those disruptions resolve and U.S. markets reopen from the holiday period, the underlying tone has reverted to risk-on, as shown by 2%+ gains in major U.S. equity futures and broad-based strength across indices. Crypto and thematic growth narratives, particularly around AI and digital assets, are contributing to broader risk sentiment on the margin. Articles discussing the AI “party just began” and institutional interest in vehicles like a Dogecoin ETF indicate ongoing enthusiasm for high-beta themes. While these are more peripheral to core equity benchmarks, they align with the observed bid for growth proxies such as the Nasdaq (7d +4.16%) and QQQ (7d +3.85%), reinforcing a risk-on psychology rather than defensive positioning.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours are centered on a resumption of full U.S. market liquidity after the holiday period, ongoing digestion of Fed rate-cut expectations, and any follow-through from recent macro data such as labor and inflation prints referenced in the news. Investors will be monitoring additional economic releases flagged as part of a “string of economic data” in this holiday week, as well as any updates or commentary related to the recent CME futures outage that could affect confidence in derivatives markets. Corporate-specific events mentioned, like regional earnings and company updates (for example, Ambarella and other tech names), may influence sector leadership but are secondary to the broader macro narrative around a potential Fed cut.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is up, given synchronized strength across major indices (S&P 500 +0.54%, Nasdaq +0.65%, Russell 2000 +0.58% on the day) and even stronger gains in equity futures (S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures up roughly 2–3.6%). Risk appetite is clearly improving as evidenced by a VIX that has collapsed about 34% over the week to 16.35 and a 10-year yield that is modestly lower over the week, aligning with news-driven expectations for Fed rate cuts. While holiday-thinned trading and recent futures outages inject some event risk, the prevailing macro narrative and price action support a modest upside bias rather than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether cash indices confirm the strength currently implied by futures, with the S&P 500 pivoting around its recent close near 6,849 and the Russell 2000 around 2,500–2,505. Sustained outperformance from small caps and tech (Russell 2000 7d +6.46%, Nasdaq Composite 7d +4.16%, QQQ 7d +3.85%) will be important to maintain the risk-on tone; any sharp intraday reversal in these higher-beta segments, especially if accompanied by a VIX bounce from 16.35, would be an early warning sign against the projected upside bias. Macro-wise, focus should remain on the 10-year Treasury yield near 4.02% and the U.S. dollar index around 99.46, as further yield softness or dollar drift lower would validate the dovish-policy, risk-on narrative underpinning the rally. Sector-wise, weakness in WTI crude (last 58.55, 7d -2.56%) should be monitored alongside energy equities for signs of either a demand scare or simple rotation away from commodities; if crude stabilizes while gold holds recent gains (Gold futures 1d +3.09%), it would suggest the market is comfortable with growth prospects while still lightly hedging, consistent with a controlled grind higher in equities. Overnight and into the open, traders should also track any fresh headlines on Fed policy expectations and the resolution of the CME futures outage, as renewed concerns there could temporarily dampen sentiment despite strong pricing. If no adverse macro or micro surprises emerge and futures hold their current 2–3% premium over prior closes, the path of least resistance remains higher for broad indices, with particular attention on whether the Russell futures can sustain levels above roughly 2,500 as a barometer of continued risk-on small-cap participation.

## 1. Pulse

Equities are trading with a distinctly risk-on tone, with all major U.S. benchmarks up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–6.5% over the week. The S&P 500 gained 0.54% (7d +3.50%), the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.65% (7d +4.16%), and small-cap Russell 2000 is the standout on a weekly basis at +6.46%, signaling broadening participation. QQQ outperformed on the day at +0.81%, confirming solid appetite for growth and tech exposure.
