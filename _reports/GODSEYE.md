  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a mixed, rotational bid on the day with the S&P 500 up 0.13%, Dow up 0.16%, and Russell 2000 leading at +0.58% while the Nasdaq lagged at -0.21%. The average index change was a modest +0.07%, signaling only a tentative improvement in risk appetite. Over the week, risk appetite has clearly faded as the S&P 500 fell 2.35%, Nasdaq dropped 3.98%, and Russell 2000 declined 2.09% (Dow -1.35%).
  
  Volatility eased intraday but remains elevated versus recent history, with VIX down 2.15% on the day to 19.08 yet up 12.77% over the week and 24.79% over the month. This backdrop points to lingering caution despite today’s slight rebound outside of tech.
  
  Futures mirror the split: S&P futures +0.09% and Russell futures +0.54% contrasted with Nasdaq futures -0.31% on the day, and all major futures remain lower on the week (NQ -4.17%, ES -2.44%). Rates were a non-factor today with the 10Y at 4.09% (0.00% 1d), though the weekly rise of 0.86% adds to the risk-off tone seen over the past week.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously neutral with a slight positive tilt: breadth showed 9 up, 5 down, and 1 flat, and the average index change was a muted +0.07%. The day’s gains outside of tech are countered by a still-elevated volatility backdrop, with VIX at 19.08 and up 12.77% week over week. The 10Y Treasury yield held steady at 4.09% on the day, suggesting rates did not drive moves today. Taken together, the tape is stable but fragile given weak weekly performance and higher implied volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to small caps and cyclicals on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.58% and the Dow up 0.16%, while growth/tech lagged as the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.21% and QQQ declined 0.32%. Over the past week, tech has clearly underperformed with the Nasdaq down 3.98% and QQQ down 4.09%, while the Dow has held up relatively better at -1.35% and the S&P 500 is down 2.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A tech-led de-risking remains the dominant macro theme, with headlines citing heavy selling in AI-linked names and semiconductors following concerns including a US ban on AI chip exports to China impacting Nvidia and broadly weaker tech sentiment. This has translated into notable underperformance in the Nasdaq (1d -0.21%, 7d -3.98%) and Nasdaq futures (1d -0.31%, 7d -4.17%), reinforcing a risk-off tilt within growth. Valuation anxiety is adding to the pressure as commentary highlights historically stretched levels and warnings of potential corrections, which align with the rise in VIX on the week (+12.77%) and the broad 7d equity declines. Such narratives typically drive risk-off positioning, particularly in megacap tech, and help explain why intraday rotations into small caps have not reversed the weekly drawdown. Macro data sensitivity is elevated, with reports noting deteriorating jobs data and layoffs in focus alongside high-profile corporate developments. These headlines have weighed on sentiment and contributed to wider risk aversion across assets, echoed by mentions of crypto ETF outflows on macro jitters, even as some indices pared losses late in the session.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed intraday performance (S&P 500 +0.13%, Russell 2000 +0.58%, Nasdaq -0.21%) and split futures (ES +0.09%, NQ -0.31%) point to rotation rather than trend. Elevated but easing-on-the-day volatility (VIX 19.08, 1d -2.15% but 7d +12.77%) and a steady 10Y at 4.09% suggest a balanced near-term setup. With weekly damage still apparent and no clear new catalyst in the provided feed, a range-bound session is the higher-probability outcome.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether tech stabilizes: Nasdaq futures around 25,166 and QQQ at 609.74 remain the pressure points; further weakness would likely cap broader risk appetite. Track the rotation signal via Russell 2000 (2,432.82) and Russell futures (2,440.60); continued relative strength in small caps would support a flat-to-stable tape even if megacap tech stays soft. Monitor macro risk gauges: VIX at 19.08 needs to continue easing to underpin stability, while the 10Y yield anchored near 4.09% would reduce rate shock risk to growth. Also keep an eye on cross-asset sentiment via the US dollar at 99.60, gold near 3,999.40, and WTI at 59.75; firm gold and a subdued oil tape remain consistent with a cautious but orderly risk backdrop.

## 1. Pulse

Equities showed a mixed, rotational bid on the day with the S&P 500 up 0.13%, Dow up 0.16%, and Russell 2000 leading at +0.58% while the Nasdaq lagged at -0.21%. The average index change was a modest +0.07%, signaling only a tentative improvement in risk appetite. Over the week, risk appetite has clearly faded as the S&P 500 fell 2.35%, Nasdaq dropped 3.98%, and Russell 2000 declined 2.09% (Dow -1.35%).

Volatility eased intraday but remains elevated versus recent history, with VIX down 2.15% on the day to 19.08 yet up 12.77% over the week and 24.79% over the month. This backdrop points to lingering caution despite today’s slight rebound outside of tech.

Futures mirror the split: S&P futures +0.09% and Russell futures +0.54% contrasted with Nasdaq futures -0.31% on the day, and all major futures remain lower on the week (NQ -4.17%, ES -2.44%). Rates were a non-factor today with the 10Y at 4.09% (0.00% 1d), though the weekly rise of 0.86% adds to the risk-off tone seen over the past week.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously neutral with a slight positive tilt: breadth showed 9 up, 5 down, and 1 flat, and the average index change was a muted +0.07%. The day’s gains outside of tech are countered by a still-elevated volatility backdrop, with VIX at 19.08 and up 12.77% week over week. The 10Y Treasury yield held steady at 4.09% on the day, suggesting rates did not drive moves today.

Over the past week, tech has clearly underperformed with the Nasdaq down 3.98% and QQQ down 4.09%, while the Dow has held up relatively better at -1.35% and the S&P 500 is down 2.35%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** A tech-led de-risking remains the dominant macro theme, with headlines citing heavy selling in AI-linked names and semiconductors following concerns including a US ban on AI chip exports to China impacting Nvidia and broadly weaker tech sentiment. This has translated into notable underperformance in the Nasdaq (1d -0.21%, 7d -3.98%) and Nasdaq futures (1d -0.31%, 7d -4.17%), reinforcing a risk-off tilt within growth. Valuation anxiety is adding to the pressure as commentary highlights historically stretched levels and warnings of potential corrections, which align with the rise in VIX on the week (+12.77%) and the broad 7d equity declines. Such narratives typically drive risk-off positioning, particularly in megacap tech, and help explain why intraday rotations into small caps have not reversed the weekly drawdown. Macro data sensitivity is elevated, with reports noting deteriorating jobs data and layoffs in focus alongside high-profile corporate developments. These headlines have weighed on sentiment and contributed to wider risk aversion across assets, echoed by mentions of crypto ETF outflows on macro jitters, even as some indices pared losses late in the session.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed intraday performance (S&P 500 +0.13%, Russell 2000 +0.58%, Nasdaq -0.21%) and split futures (ES +0.09%, NQ -0.31%) point to rotation rather than trend. Elevated but easing-on-the-day volatility (VIX 19.08, 1d -2.15% but 7d +12.77%) and a steady 10Y at 4.09% suggest a balanced near-term setup. With weekly damage still apparent and no clear new catalyst in the provided feed, a range-bound session is the higher-probability outcome.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether tech stabilizes: Nasdaq futures around 25,166 and QQQ at 609.74 remain the pressure points; further weakness would likely cap broader risk appetite. Track the rotation signal via Russell 2000 (2,432.82) and Russell futures (2,440.60); continued relative strength in small caps would support a flat-to-stable tape even if megacap tech stays soft. Monitor macro risk gauges: VIX at 19.08 needs to continue easing to underpin stability, while the 10Y yield anchored near 4.09% would reduce rate shock risk to growth. Also keep an eye on cross-asset sentiment via the US dollar at 99.60, gold near 3,999.40, and WTI at 59.75; firm gold and a subdued oil tape remain consistent with a cautious but orderly risk backdrop.
