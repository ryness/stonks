  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is fading as equities sold off across the board: S&P 500 fell 1.00% on the day, Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.56%, and Russell 2000 declined 1.11%, with 7-day losses running roughly 4.0% to 5.6% across major U.S. benchmarks. The average 1-day index change across the monitor was -1.15%, underscoring broad pressure rather than an isolated move.
  
  Volatility is rising sharply, reinforcing the risk-off tone. The VIX closed at 25.23, up 6.64% on the day and 46.01% over the week, signaling heightened demand for protection as downside momentum builds.
  
  Futures point the same way, with S&P futures down 1.00% and Nasdaq futures off 1.76% on the day. Rates eased modestly, with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.65% to 4.11; lower yields alongside a surging VIX are consistent with a de-risking backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak. Breadth showed just 1 up vs 14 down, and the average 1-day index change was -1.15%, confirming widespread selling. The VIX is elevated at 25.23 after a 6.64% daily jump and 46.01% rise over the week, pointing to stressed risk sentiment. While the 10Y Treasury yield dipped 0.65% to 4.11, the modest bid for duration is not offsetting the equity and volatility signals of strain.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed defensive on the day, with the Dow 30 the relative standout at -0.43% while growth-heavy QQQ lagged at -1.80% and the Nasdaq Composite at -1.56%. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed most, with the Russell 2000 down 5.55% and the Nasdaq Composite down 5.36%, while the S&P 500/SPY fared comparatively better at -3.95%/-3.94%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI and megacap tech are in focus as markets await Nvidia’s earnings, with multiple reports highlighting elevated AI valuations and positioning ahead of the print; this aligns with outsized weakness in growth benchmarks (QQQ -1.80% 1d, Nasdaq -1.56% 1d), a clear risk-off impulse tied to a single, market-moving catalyst. Consumer and housing sensitivity are flashing caution as Home Depot and Lowe’s flagged profit pressure amid high mortgage rates and softer demand, pointing to a weak housing backdrop. This narrative supports cyclicals under strain and a defensive bid, consistent with broad equity declines and a firmer volatility regime. Macro tone remains fragile per reports of a ‘deadly confluence’ driving global risk-off—fading rate-cut hopes alongside a VIX spike—while investors also await U.S. jobs data. The combination maps directly to today’s setup: VIX +46% over the week, equities lower across styles and caps, and the 10Y yield edging down, all consistent with a de-risking phase.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings (Q3 FY2026) within the next 24 hours is the key catalyst; given tech’s leadership in the selloff, guidance and demand commentary could swing index futures and volatility. U.S. jobs data highlighted in recent coverage is also due and could recalibrate rate expectations and the VIX, influencing equities and Treasury yields.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% - Broad 1-day declines (S&P 500 -1.00%, Nasdaq -1.56%, Russell -1.11%), weak breadth (1 up, 14 down), and a rising VIX (25.23, +6.64% 1d; +46.01% 7d) signal persistent risk-off, while futures are already negative (ES -1.00%, NQ -1.76%). With Nvidia earnings and jobs data as near-term catalysts and tech leading weakness, the balance of risks leans toward further downside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures and volatility as the immediate tell: S&P futures near 6,594.75 and Nasdaq futures around 24,287.75, with the VIX at 25.23. Sustained trade with VIX above 25 and inability for ES/NQ to reclaim their prior sessions’ levels would validate continued risk-off. Monitor leadership and dispersion: tech/AI proxies like QQQ (-1.80% 1d) and small caps via Russell futures (RTY 2,325.00, -1.27% 1d). Continued underperformance from growth and small caps versus the Dow (-0.44% in futures) would align with a defensive, lower-beta bias into the next session. Keep an eye on macro signposts that frame the tape: the 10Y Treasury at 4.11 (-0.65% 1d) and the U.S. Dollar at 100.19 (+0.73% 7d). A firmer dollar and steady-to-lower yields alongside WTI at 58.94 (-0.84% 1d) would be consistent with a cautious growth and demand backdrop ahead of Nvidia’s report and the jobs data.
