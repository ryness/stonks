  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite faded during the cash session as major U.S. indices declined broadly: S&P 500 -0.83%, Nasdaq Composite -1.22%, and Dow -1.07%, while small caps bucked the trend with the Russell 2000 up 0.31%. Volatility eased on the day (VIX -2.92%) but remains elevated at 23.97, up 36% over the week and 47% over the month, signaling a still-fragile backdrop.
  
  Overnight futures show a tentative stabilizing bid with S&P futures +0.27%, Nasdaq futures +0.32%, Dow futures +0.11%, and Russell futures +0.34%. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped 1d to 4.12% (-0.24%), modestly supporting risk, but its flat 30d change and the higher VIX skew the tone toward caution rather than a decisive risk-on.
  
  On a 7-day look, risk appetite has deteriorated meaningfully: S&P 500 -1.66%, Dow -1.91%, Nasdaq -2.49%, and Russell -3.46%, with futures similarly softer (e.g., Nasdaq futures -4.04%, Russell futures -4.08%). The combination of weaker equities, higher volatility, firmer dollar (+0.20% 1d; +0.91% 30d), and defensive gold strength (+1.26% 1d; +1.71% 30d) underscores a risk-off tilt despite the mild overnight bounce.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is soft: breadth was slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average 1-day index change was -0.81%, reflecting broad selling pressure. The VIX sits at 23.97, down on the day but up 36% over the week, indicating elevated stress versus recent norms. The 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 4.12% on the day and is roughly flat over 30 days, offering only modest relief. Overall, the mix of weak breadth, negative average performance, and higher volatility points to a fragile market with caution prevailing.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated defensively on the day, with the Russell 2000 as a positive standout (+0.31% 1d) while mega-cap tech lagged via the Nasdaq Composite (-1.22% 1d) and QQQ (-1.22% 1d). Over the past week, small caps and growth have underperformed most notably (Russell 2000 -3.46% 7d; Nasdaq Composite -2.49% 7d), while the S&P 500 (-1.66% 7d) and Dow (-1.91% 7d) fell less. The day’s positive outlier was the Russell, and the negative standout was the Nasdaq/QQQ complex.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Earnings and AI sentiment are central: headlines note stocks falling ahead of Nvidia’s results and U.S. economic data, with European markets also pressured on renewed AI worries. This has skewed risk tone to risk-off in recent sessions (elevated VIX and weaker indices), while the current modest futures rebound suggests positioning into a key, binary catalyst. Energy is a crosscurrent: oil slipped as traders weighed oversupply prospects versus risks to Russian flows, with WTI -0.81% 1d and -3.68% over 30d. Softer crude can ease inflation concerns (incrementally risk-on for rates-sensitive equities), but supply-demand uncertainty keeps volatility elevated and caps risk appetite. Policy expectations remain a background drag: recent coverage points to hawkish-leaning Fed commentary unsettling markets, aligning with higher week-on-week volatility and weaker risk assets. With the 10-year yield steady near 4.12% and the dollar firmer, the policy backdrop adds to a cautious, data-dependent tape.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings within the next 24 hours are the primary catalyst, with potential to swing tech and broader risk sentiment; a strong print could support a rebound while disappointment risks further de-risking. U.S. economic data and jobs-related updates flagged in headlines are also in focus, with stronger data potentially lifting yields and pressuring duration-sensitive equities. Oil market headlines around supply and Russian flows could move energy and inflation expectations at the margin.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The modestly green futures (ES +0.27%, NQ +0.32%) and a 1-day dip in VIX (-2.92%) suggest a stabilization attempt, but elevated weekly volatility (+36% VIX w/w) and recent equity losses (SPX -1.66% 7d) argue for caution. With Nvidia earnings as a binary catalyst and the 10-year yield only slightly lower at 4.12%, the balance of signals favors a range-bound session.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures relative to their latest marks—ES 6,658, NQ 24,675, YM 46,235, and RTY 2,364—to gauge whether the overnight bid can persist into the open; sustained trade above these levels would help validate a flat-to-stable bias. Also monitor the VIX near 24; a move higher would undermine stabilization, while a drift lower would support constructive tone. Focus on mega-cap tech around Nvidia’s print via QQQ (last 596.31, -1.22% 1d) and the Nasdaq Composite (-1.22% 1d) as leadership will likely dictate broader direction. Small caps (Russell 2000 +0.31% 1d) are a tell for breadth—continued relative strength would temper downside risk, whereas renewed underperformance would confirm risk-off. Keep an eye on macro levers: the 10-year yield around 4.12% (down 0.24% 1d) and the U.S. dollar at 99.75 (+0.20% 1d). A yield uptick alongside a firmer dollar could pressure equities, while steadier rates would help a neutral tape; in commodities, WTI near $60 and gold at 4,112 add color on inflation expectations and risk hedging.
