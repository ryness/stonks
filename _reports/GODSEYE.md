  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a modest risk-on rebound today with the S&P 500 up 0.58%, the Nasdaq Composite up 0.89%, and the Dow up 0.18%, while the Russell 2000 lagged at -0.07%. Breadth was constructive at 10 up vs 5 down and the average 1-day index change was +0.50%, pointing to an improvement in risk appetite versus recent sessions.
  
  The volatility backdrop remains cautious despite a daily pullback: VIX fell 3.73% to 23.77 on the day but is still up 35% over the week and 46% over the month, signaling elevated risk premia. Futures echo a tentative tech-led stabilization with S&P +0.24%, Nasdaq +0.39%, Dow -0.10%, and Russell -0.06% over 1 day.
  
  Rates and FX lean risk-off at the margin, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.24% on the day to 4.13% and the US dollar up 0.65%. The mix suggests near-term risk appetite is improving intraday, but remains fragile given higher volatility, firmer yields, and a stronger dollar.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive on the day: breadth is positive at 10 up vs 5 down, and the average index change is +0.50%. However, the VIX at 23.77 remains elevated despite a 3.73% daily drop, and the 10Y Treasury yield edged up to 4.13%, tempering risk-taking. The combination points to a short-term bounce within a shakier weekly backdrop. Overall, conditions are better than the prior sessions but not robust.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is concentrated in large-cap tech, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.89% today and QQQ up 0.85%, while the Russell 2000 was a notable laggard at -0.07%. Over the past week, small caps have led the downside with the Russell 2000 down 4.42%, and the Nasdaq also weaker at -3.80%, versus the S&P 500 at -2.59% and the Dow at -2.52%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI and mega-cap tech remain the key macro driver, with Nvidia’s earnings in focus amid headlines citing market selloff pressures and fears of an ‘AI crash.’ This setup concentrates market sensitivity in tech leadership, creating a risk-on impulse if guidance reassures on AI demand, or a risk-off air pocket if expectations are not met, as reflected by an elevated VIX (+35% 7d) despite today’s dip. Recent weakness tied to valuation worries in big technology-related shares and a disappointing Home Depot forecast pressured the prior US session, according to Moneycontrol. That backdrop helps explain why small caps underperformed (Russell 2000 -4.42% over 7d) and why today’s rebound is cautious, with a stronger dollar (+0.65% 1d) and lower oil (-2.52% 1d) reinforcing a defensive macro tone even as tech stabilizes.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings report within the next 24 hours is the primary catalyst; upbeat demand and guidance could lift tech and broader indices, while a miss or cautious outlook could extend the recent risk-off tone seen over the week.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Given today’s modest rebound (S&P 500 +0.58%, Nasdaq +0.89%) and slightly positive futures (ES +0.24%, NQ +0.39%) versus an elevated VIX (23.77, +35% 7d), firmer dollar (+0.65% 1d), and weak small caps (Russell 2000 -4.42% 7d), the tape is balanced. Nvidia’s earnings present a binary catalyst likely to keep indices range-bound over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch mega-cap tech into and after Nvidia’s print; Nasdaq futures at 24,692 and S&P futures at 6,656 are key pivot areas for a hold-or-break reaction. Sustained trade above these levels would support stabilization, while a break lower would confirm that the weekly downtrend remains in control. Monitor the Russell complex for confirmation of breadth: Russell futures at 2,354 and the Russell 2000 cash at 2,347 need to stabilize to broaden any rally. Keep an eye on the VIX around 23–24 and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.13%; a drift lower in VIX and a steady-to-softer yield would align with a flat-to-firmer tape. Track cross-asset signals: a stronger dollar at 100.19 and weaker WTI crude at 59.21 have coincided with defensiveness; any reversal there could ease pressure on cyclicals. Breadth (currently 10 up vs 5 down) should remain positive to validate any post-earnings stabilization.
