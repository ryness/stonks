  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-10T10:27:41.708628+00:00">2025-11-10 10:27 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 30s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities were mixed but slightly positive on the day, with the S&P 500 +0.13%, Dow +0.16%, Russell 2000 +0.58%, and Nasdaq Composite -0.21%. Breadth skewed supportive at 10 up, 4 down, and 1 flat, while the average index change was a mild +0.07%, indicating a tentative improvement in risk appetite despite ongoing tech softness.
  
  Volatility eased and futures firmed, adding to the constructive tone into the next session: VIX fell 2.15% to 18.67, while S&P futures rose 0.97%, Nasdaq futures +1.50%, Dow futures +0.43%, and Russell futures +1.20%. This combination points to improving near-term risk appetite.
  
  Rates are steady near-term with the 10Y Treasury at 4.09% (1d 0.00%), but the weekly backdrop still leans risk-off: equities are lower over 7d (S&P -2.35%, Nasdaq -3.98%, Russell -2.09%) and VIX is higher (+10.41% w/w). Net-net, risk appetite has faded on the week even as today’s tape shows signs of stabilization.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive. Breadth was positive (10 up, 4 down, 1 flat) and the average index change was modest at +0.07%, suggesting a tentative bid. However, VIX at 18.67 is down on the day but elevated over 30 days (+15.82%), and the 10Y yield sits at 4.09% with a 7d uptick (+0.86%), tempering the signal. Overall, conditions look stable but fragile given the recent weekly drawdown and higher volatility regime.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted toward small caps and away from mega-cap tech: the Russell 2000 was a standout at +0.58% 1d, while the Nasdaq Composite lagged at -0.21% 1d (QQQ -0.32% 1d). Over the last week, the Dow held up best at -1.35% while the Nasdaq underperformed at -3.98%, highlighting ongoing pressure in growth-heavy benchmarks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A tech-led de-risking remains a central theme, with reports citing the worst tech sell-off since April and renewed concerns about AI-driven valuations and chip weakness; this aligns with the 7d underperformance in the Nasdaq (-3.98%) and QQQ (-4.09%), reinforcing a risk-off skew in growth equities (Yahoo Entertainment; Yahoo Entertainment/Global chip valuations coverage). Macro signals around a cooling labor market and deteriorating jobs data are fostering caution, as noted in week-ahead coverage, while gold’s +2.26% 1d jump underscores hedging demand; together with a flat-but-firmer 10Y on the week (+0.86% 7d), this combination has pressured sentiment (The Times of India; Yahoo Entertainment). Policy and valuation overhangs persist, with mentions of a prolonged government shutdown adding uncertainty and recent commentary warning on elevated market valuations; the weekly rise in VIX (+10.41%) corroborates that risk premium remains elevated even as futures rebound (The Times of India; Fortune).
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. confidence data and scheduled Fed speak over the next 24 hours (per Barchart) are key catalysts; stronger readings or a benign tone could support the current futures rebound, while softer confidence or hawkish commentary could revive risk-off and keep volatility elevated.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%: Futures are broadly higher (ES +0.97%, NQ +1.50%, RTY +1.20%) with VIX lower (-2.15% to 18.67) and breadth supportive (10 up vs 4 down), pointing to a constructive open, though confidence is capped by the 7d equity declines and a higher weekly VIX (+10.41%).
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P futures can hold above roughly 6,800 and Nasdaq futures near 25,545; sustained strength there would support follow-through in the cash S&P 500 (6,728.80) and help narrow recent tech underperformance. Monitor rotation: small caps led on the day (Russell 2000 +0.58% 1d; RTY futures +1.20%), while mega-cap tech lagged (Nasdaq Composite -0.21%, QQQ -0.32%); continued rotation toward cyclicals would keep breadth constructive and reinforce an up-bias. Keep an eye on VIX around the 18–19 area and the 10Y at 4.09%; further easing in volatility and stable rates would validate upside, while a push back above 19 VIX or additional 7d firmness in yields could cap gains. Also note gold’s +2.26% 1d pop as a barometer of lingering hedging demand.
