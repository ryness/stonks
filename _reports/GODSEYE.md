  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities are under pressure with broad-based declines: S&P 500 fell 1.56% on the day and 4.50% over the week, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.15% on the day and 5.92% over the week, and the Russell 2000 slid 1.82% on the day and 6.23% over the week, while the Dow lost 0.84% on the day and 4.54% over the week. Risk appetite is fading as volatility climbed with the VIX at 27.5, up 4.09% on the day and 57.05% over the week, signaling a materially higher risk premium.
  
  Futures point to tentative stabilization but remain mixed: S&P futures are down 0.27% on the day, Nasdaq futures down 0.59%, and Russell futures down 0.22%, while Dow futures are modestly higher by 0.16%. The US Dollar is slightly firmer (DXY +0.07% on the day, +0.75% over the week) and WTI crude is weaker (-2.69% on the day), consistent with a risk-off tilt and growth concerns.
  
  Rates show a mild flight-to-quality tone with the 10Y Treasury yield easing 0.65% on the day to 4.11% and down 1.01% over 30 days. The combination of rising volatility and softer yields alongside equity weakness quantifies deteriorating sentiment rather than improving risk-taking.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak: breadth shows just 3 up versus 12 down and the average index change over 1 day is -1.71%. Elevated volatility (VIX 27.5, +57% over 7 days) underscores stressed conditions. While the 10Y Treasury yield ticked lower to 4.11% (-0.65% on the day), suggesting a safety bid, it has not offset the drawdown across major indices. Overall, the backdrop is fragile with risk appetite fading.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is narrow and defensive: Dow futures are a rare positive standout at +0.16% on the day, while risk proxies lag with QQQ down 2.37% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.15%. Small caps also underperformed with the Russell 2000 down 1.82% on the day. The mix points to defensive preference over growth and beta.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI leadership remains a key macro tape driver: Nvidia’s strong earnings and upbeat forecast revived confidence in the AI trade, with reports noting Nasdaq 100 futures up 1.6%, S&P 500 up 1.2%, and Dow futures up 0.5% at the time, and Nvidia rising about 5% in extended trading. This catalyst is risk-on for mega-cap tech and semis, though current Nasdaq futures (-0.59% on the day) show that the boost is contending with broader risk-off forces. Broader macro worries are weighing: coverage highlights a ‘wrong-way’ mix of news with fading hopes for Fed rate cuts amid a slowdown, coinciding with a spike in the VIX. That aligns with the data showing VIX at 27.5 (+57% over 7 days) and broad U.S. equity declines, reinforcing a risk-off tone. Rate expectations remain in focus around labor data per commodity and macro commentary noting lingering, fading rate-cut hopes and attention on U.S. jobs figures. A firm labor print would likely keep cuts priced out and pressure risk, while softer data could ease yields and volatility.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down, 60% — Major indices fell 0.8%–2.2% on the day and 4.5%–6.3% over the week, breadth is weak (3 up, 12 down), and the VIX is elevated at 27.5 (+57% over 7 days). Futures are mixed to slightly negative (ES -0.27%, NQ -0.59%, RTY -0.22%, YM +0.16%), and oil weakness adds to growth concerns, suggesting downside risk outweighs support from modestly lower 10Y yields.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech and high-beta gauges for follow-through: Nasdaq futures at 23,988.5 and QQQ (-2.37% on the day) will set the tone; sustained weakness there would likely keep the broader tape heavy. Monitor the VIX at 27.5; a move higher would confirm ongoing stress, while a pullback would be an early sign of stabilization. Keep an eye on small caps and cyclicals: the Russell 2000 is under pressure (1d -1.82%, 7d -6.23%), and WTI at 57.55 (1d -2.69%) signals growth caution that could weigh on energy and industrials. Track S&P futures at 6,539.75 and 10Y yields at 4.11; further equity slippage alongside a bid into Treasuries would validate a defensive tilt. Dollar dynamics matter for cross-asset flows: the DXY at 100.23 (1d +0.07%, 7d +0.75%) remains a headwind for risk if it firms further. Any easing in the dollar coupled with lower volatility would help support a bounce; absent that, weakness in growth and small-cap benchmarks likely persists.
