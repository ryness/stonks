  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities the tone is broadly risk-on, with all major US indices higher on the day and an average index gain of about 0.94%. The Nasdaq Composite is leading with a +1.31% move, followed by the S&P 500 at +0.88% and Russell 2000 at +0.86%, suggesting improving appetite for growth and small caps after a choppy week. However, on a 7-day basis the S&P 500 (-0.76%) and Nasdaq (-1.46%) are still negative, so today's bid is more of a rebound than a full trend shift.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm a constructive tone but with only modest follow-through. The VIX is down sharply, -11.6% on the day and nearly -17.2% over 30 days to 14.9, indicating fading demand for downside protection and a clear pickup in risk appetite. Equity futures are up but more cautiously than cash indices, with S&P futures +0.27%, Nasdaq futures +0.42%, and Dow futures +0.21% on the day while still down 1–2.6% over the week, implying traders are pricing in stability rather than an aggressive extension higher.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed but not hostile to risk. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15% yet down slightly over 7 days, implying modest rate pressure but no acute shock to equities. Gold is firmly higher over 7 and 30 days (+3.93% and +9.59%), while crude is up on the day (+0.91%) but lower over the week (-3.08%), and the US Dollar is little changed near term; together these point to selective hedging but not a broad risk-off move. On balance, risk appetite is improving in the short term, especially in tech and cyclicals, but sits against a backdrop of recent weekly softness and higher yields that could cap enthusiasm.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the very near term. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up versus only 2 down and none flat, and the average 1-day index change around +0.94% shows gains are not narrowly confined. The sharp 11.6% drop in VIX to 14.9 signals comfortable risk-taking, while a modest 0.85% uptick in the 10-year yield to 4.15% suggests rates are a headwind but not disruptive today. Taken together, the market appears healthy for now, though the slightly higher yield backdrop and negative 7-day returns in key benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq argue against complacency.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, growth and tech-related benchmarks are leading, with the Nasdaq Composite up +1.31% and QQQ up +1.30%, while the S&P 500 and SPY also post solid gains near +0.9%. On the lagging side today, Russell futures are marginally negative at -0.02% even as the cash Russell 2000 is +0.86%, highlighting some small-cap caution in forward pricing. Over the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (-1.46%) and QQQ (-1.68%) are clear underperformers despite today's bounce, whereas the Dow 30 (+0.16%) and Russell 2000 (+0.13%) are relative leaders with small positive 7-day returns.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A key macro driver today is the Bank of Japan's interest-rate hike, which has pushed global bond yields higher but coincided with equity gains. Headlines note that US stocks are poised to close out a choppy week on a steady, higher note as traders gear up for a typically supportive year-end stretch, while bond yields advance following the BOJ move. This combination—stocks ticking higher as yields rise—indicates that the BOJ action is being digested as a manageable tightening, leaning risk-on in equities even as it nudges rates up and supports a firmer global yield environment. The BOJ decision is also lifting broader risk appetite in Asia and in alternative assets, with reports that the rate hike helped lift Asian risk appetite and contributed to pops in Bitcoin and ether. Additional coverage describes Asia stocks rallying with Wall Street around the BOJ action, suggesting a synchronized, cross-regional relief rally rather than localized stress. This backdrop favors a risk-on tone in global equities and crypto even as Japan's 10-year yield briefly touched multi-decade highs, underscoring that investors view the normalization as a sign of economic resilience rather than a trigger for de-risking. Other macro narratives in the tape, such as commentary on central bank decisions in Europe and the UK and discussions of AI-related equity valuations and potential bubble dynamics, serve more as medium-term framing than immediate catalysts in today's moves. Articles highlighting that investors remain broadly bullish on stocks even amid selective AI-related selloffs, plus expectations around central bank meetings, support the idea of a constructive but discriminating risk environment. Together with the BOJ-driven yield shift, these themes point to a market that is leaning risk-on but still mindful of policy and valuation risks, rather than in an uncritical chase higher.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours include central bank decisions and related commentary, particularly residual reactions to the Bank of Japan's rate hike as markets parse guidance on further tightening, which could influence global yields and equity sentiment. Data-wise, markets are also watching for additional jobs-related signals referenced in coverage of Wall Street weighing jobs data, which could affect expectations around US rate paths and thus risk appetite. On the corporate side, scheduled earnings such as FedEx and Darden Restaurants (flagged as key reports for tomorrow) may act as micro catalysts for transports and consumer sectors, offering read-throughs on demand and margins.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence – Major US indices are all higher on the day with the Nasdaq Composite up +1.31%, S&P 500 up +0.88%, and Russell 2000 up +0.86%, while the VIX has dropped 11.6% to 14.9, indicating a firm risk-on tilt and reduced hedging demand. Futures are modestly positive (S&P +0.27%, Nasdaq +0.42%), and global context around the BOJ hike shows equities digesting higher yields constructively as part of a year-end supportive backdrop. However, negative 7-day performance in S&P and Nasdaq and a 0.85% rise in the 10-year yield temper conviction, suggesting an upward bias is more likely to continue but with limited upside rather than a strong breakout.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether S&P futures can hold above recent gains and track the cash S&P 500's ability to sustain its current rebound after a -0.76% 7-day pullback. Monitoring the VIX near the 15 level will be important; continued suppression or further declines from the current 14.9 would corroborate the call for an upward bias, while a sharp reversal higher in volatility alongside the 10-year yield pushing materially above its current 4.15% could quickly challenge the risk-on tone. Tech leadership via the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, both up about 1.3% today but still negative on the week, should also be monitored for confirmation that the growth bounce is sticking rather than fading. Overnight and into the next session, focus on cross-asset reactions to the BOJ rate hike and global bond yield moves, as these have been central to the day's narrative of stocks ticking higher despite rising rates. Sector-wise, keep an eye on small caps and cyclicals represented by the Russell 2000 and its futures, where today's cash strength (+0.86%) contrasts with slightly negative Russell futures (-0.02%), as resolution of that divergence will signal whether risk rotates more broadly beyond large-cap tech. Additionally, corporate earnings like FedEx and Darden Restaurants may influence transports and consumer names and provide fresh guidance on demand trends that either support a continued grind higher or cap the rally.

## 1. Pulse

Across equities the tone is broadly risk-on, with all major US indices higher on the day and an average index gain of about 0.94%. The Nasdaq Composite is leading with a +1.31% move, followed by the S&P 500 at +0.88% and Russell 2000 at +0.86%, suggesting improving appetite for growth and small caps after a choppy week. However, on a 7-day basis the S&P 500 (-0.76%) and Nasdaq (-1.46%) are still negative, so today's bid is more of a rebound than a full trend shift.

Volatility and futures confirm a constructive tone but with only modest follow-through. The VIX is down sharply, -11.6% on the day and nearly -17.2% over 30 days to 14.9, indicating fading demand for downside protection and a clear pickup in risk appetite. Equity futures are up but more cautiously than cash indices, with S&P futures +0.27%, Nasdaq futures +0.42%, and Dow futures +0.21% on the day while still down 1–2.6% over the week, implying traders are pricing in stability rather than an aggressive extension higher.

Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed but not hostile to risk. The 10-year Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15% yet down slightly over 7 days, implying modest rate pressure but no acute shock to equities. Gold is firmly higher over 7 and 30 days (+3.93% and +9.59%), while crude is up on the day (+0.91%) but lower over the week (-3.08%), and the US Dollar is little changed near term; together these point to selective hedging but not a broad risk-off move. On balance, risk appetite is improving in the short term, especially in tech and cyclicals, but sits against a backdrop of recent weekly softness and higher yields that could cap enthusiasm.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the very near term. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up versus only 2 down and none flat, and the average 1-day index change around +0.94% shows gains are not narrowly confined. The sharp 11.6% drop in VIX to 14.9 signals comfortable risk-taking, while a modest 0.85% uptick in the 10-year yield to 4.15% suggests rates are a headwind but not disruptive today. Taken together, the market appears healthy for now, though the slightly higher yield backdrop and negative 7-day returns in key benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq argue against complacency.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, growth and tech-related benchmarks are leading, with the Nasdaq Composite up +1.31% and QQQ up +1.30%, while the S&P 500 and SPY also post solid gains near +0.9%. On the lagging side today, Russell futures are marginally negative at -0.02% even as the cash Russell 2000 is +0.86%, highlighting some small-cap caution in forward pricing. Over the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (-1.46%) and QQQ (-1.68%) are clear underperformers despite today's bounce, whereas the Dow 30 (+0.16%) and Russell 2000 (+0.13%) are relative leaders with small positive 7-day returns.

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence – Major US indices are all higher on the day with the Nasdaq Composite up +1.31%, S&P 500 up +0.88%, and Russell 2000 up +0.86%, while the VIX has dropped 11.6% to 14.9, indicating a firm risk-on tilt and reduced hedging demand.
