  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is currently firming, with all major US equity benchmarks higher on the day and week. The S&P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over 7 days, while the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +0.81% 1d and +1.08% 7d, and the Russell 2000 is outperforming on a weekly basis with +4.94% over 7 days. ETFs mirror this tone, with SPY up 0.66% and QQQ up 1.00% on the day, signaling broad participation in the risk-on move.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm the constructive tone. The VIX is down 6.21% on the day to 14.49 and nearly 22% over 30 days, indicating easing hedging demand alongside equities grinding higher. Equity futures are green across the board, with S&P futures up 0.62%, Nasdaq futures up 0.98%, and Russell futures up 0.71% on the day, reinforcing that risk appetite is improving rather than fading in the very near term.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are supportive but not exuberant. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially stable to slightly lower on the day at 4.17% (-0.29% 1d) but remains about 4.22% higher over 30 days, indicating that the market is digesting a higher-rate backdrop without derailing risk assets. At the same time, gold is up 0.91% on the day and 8.48% over 30 days, and WTI crude has gained 2.35% on the day, suggesting some demand for hedges and real assets even as equities and volatility metrics point to an overall risk-on environment.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid to strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is very positive, with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1-day index change at about +0.73% signals a broad advance rather than a narrow leadership surge. The VIX at 14.49, down 6.21% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days, indicates a benign volatility backdrop that typically supports risk-taking. Although the 10-year yield has risen 4.22% over 30 days to 4.17%, today's slight pullback suggests rates are not currently pressuring equities, keeping overall market health in favorable territory.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, growth and small caps are leading, with QQQ up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.81%. On a weekly basis, small caps are the clear standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.73%, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.02% and Nasdaq's 1.08% gains. The relative laggard in the major complex today is the Dow 30 at +0.48% 1d and Dow futures at +0.47% 1d, showing more muted performance versus tech and small caps, even though it is still positive.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro policy and data are central drivers, with jobs data and Federal Reserve expectations shaping risk sentiment. Headlines note that payrolls data are cementing the view that the Fed will not cut rates imminently, while another piece highlights that mixed US economic data are influencing Fed rate-cut expectations and that US Treasuries have recently held gains. This combination of resilient jobs data and steady bonds is generally risk-on in the near term, as evidenced by today's equity gains and lower VIX, but it keeps a medium-term overhang via higher 10-year yields that have risen 4.22% over 30 days. Trade and tariff policy are another key theme driving the tape. Multiple reports flag a potential Supreme Court tariff ruling and broader tariff worries as focal points for investors, with one article emphasizing that markets are watching whether today's NFP data, the SCOTUS tariff ruling, and Fed comments could trigger significant US market volatility. This cluster of tariff and policy risks is a classic risk-off catalyst, but the current session's equity strength and VIX decline suggest markets are, for now, leaning to risk-on while remaining sensitive to any adverse rulings or headlines. Geopolitics and commodities are also influential in the background. Coverage of geopolitical tensions, especially around Venezuela and broader regional energy dynamics, appears alongside reports that US stocks recently rallied on strength in energy, AI, and defense stocks, while WTI crude is up 2.35% on the day and 2.02% over 7 and 30 days. This indicates that geopolitical uncertainty is feeding into higher energy prices and selective sector strength; that mix can be modestly risk-on for defense and energy names but carries latent risk-off potential if tensions escalate and oil moves more sharply.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the key potential movers are clustered around US macro and policy events cited in the news flow. Fresh US jobs data (NFP and related labor metrics) are highlighted as a key input for Federal Reserve expectations and could sway both yields and equities depending on whether they reinforce or challenge the current no-cut baseline. A potential Supreme Court tariff ruling is specifically flagged as a major risk event that could drive sector rotation, with trade-sensitive and industrial names most exposed if tariffs are upheld or expanded. Additionally, scheduled or unscheduled Fed commentary referenced in the coverage could recalibrate the rate path narrative, shifting the balance between growth and value and influencing overall risk appetite.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up,65% The most likely direction for the next 24 hours is modestly up, given the synchronized strength across major indices (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78% on the day) and futures (Nasdaq futures +0.98%, S&P futures +0.62%, Russell futures +0.71%), alongside a 6.21% drop in the VIX to 14.49. Market breadth is strongly positive (13 up, 2 down), and the 10-year yield is slightly lower on the day, which supports risk assets even in a higher-rate 30-day context. While upcoming jobs data, Fed commentary, and a possible Supreme Court tariff ruling could inject volatility and represent downside risks, the current configuration of higher equities, lower volatility, and firm futures argues that the path of least resistance over the next session is still upward.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the current leadership profile persists, especially in the Nasdaq and Russell 2000, which are outperforming with 1-day gains of 0.81% and 0.78%, and Nasdaq futures up 0.98%. Continued strength in QQQ (+1.00% 1d) relative to SPY (+0.66% 1d) would confirm that growth and tech remain in control of the tape, while any reversal there could foreshadow a broader pause. Monitoring how S&P 500 and S&P futures trade around their recent gains (S&P 500 +2.96% over 30 days, S&P futures +3.30% over 30 days) will help gauge whether the move is extending or stalling. Given the macro backdrop, close attention to rates, volatility, and cross-asset hedges is warranted. The 10-year Treasury yield at 4.17% has climbed 4.22% over 30 days but eased 0.29% today; a renewed push higher could cap the equity advance, while further stabilization would support the current risk-on bias. The VIX at 14.49, down 21.93% over 30 days, is a key sentiment gauge; a break higher from here on the back of jobs data or tariff headlines would signal a shift away from today's constructive tone. Finally, moves in gold (+0.91% 1d, +8.48% 30d) and WTI crude (+2.35% 1d) should be watched as barometers of geopolitical and inflation risk that could either undercut or reinforce the equity rally into the next session.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Risk appetite is currently firming, with all major US equity benchmarks higher on the day and week. The S&P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over 7 days, while the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +0.81% 1d and +1.08% 7d, and the Russell 2000 is outperforming on a weekly basis with +4.94% over 7 days. ETFs mirror this tone, with SPY up 0.66% and QQQ up 1.00% on the day, signaling broad participation in the risk-on move.

Volatility and futures confirm the constructive tone. The VIX is down 6.21% on the day to 14.49 and nearly 22% over 30 days, indicating easing hedging demand alongside equities grinding higher. Equity futures are green across the board, with S&P futures up 0.62%, Nasdaq futures up 0.98%, and Russell futures up 0.71% on the day, reinforcing that risk appetite is improving rather than fading in the very near term.

Rates and cross-asset signals are supportive but not exuberant. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially stable to slightly lower on the day at 4.17% (-0.29% 1d) but remains about 4.22% higher over 30 days, indicating that the market is digesting a higher-rate backdrop without derailing risk assets.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, growth and small caps are leading, with QQQ up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.81%. On a weekly basis, small caps are the clear standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.73%, outpacing the S&P 500's 1.02% and Nasdaq's 1.08% gains. The relative laggard in the major complex today is the Dow 30 at +0.48% 1d and Dow futures at +0.47% 1d, showing more muted performance versus tech and small caps, even though it is still positive.
