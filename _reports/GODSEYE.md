  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities and index futures show a clear risk-on tilt today: S&P 500 +0.90%, Nasdaq Composite +1.63%, Russell 2000 +1.03%, and Dow 30 +0.29%, with futures echoing the strength (ES +0.99%, NQ +1.78%, RTY +1.04%). Breadth is constructive at 12 up vs 3 down and the average index change is +1.05%, indicating improving risk appetite on the session despite recent weakness.
  
  Volatility eased with VIX down 7.04% on the day to 21.78, though it remains elevated versus the past week and month (+8.90% 7d, +14.45% 30d), signaling lingering macro unease. Rates are modestly supportive with the 10Y Treasury yield at 4.05% (-0.22% 1d, -1.41% 7d), while commodities are mixed (Gold +0.35% 1d, WTI -0.14% 1d) and the US Dollar is slightly firmer over the week (+1.07% 7d). Overall, risk appetite is improving today but from a still-fragile backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive on the day, with breadth at 12 up and 3 down and an average index gain of 1.05%. The VIX fell 7.04% to 21.78, easing immediate stress, but remains higher on a 7d and 30d basis, which tempers conviction. The 10Y Treasury yield at 4.05% is lower on the day and week, providing a supportive backdrop for equities. Taken together, conditions look healthier intraday but not fully out of the woods given elevated volatility versus recent history.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to growth: the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.63% on the day while the Dow 30 lagged at +0.29%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 is the relative leader among major US indexes at +0.46% 7d, while the Dow 30 is the notable laggard at -2.27% 7d. A negative standout on the day was WTI Crude at -0.14%, contrasting with equity strength.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Easing rate expectations supported risk sentiment, as prior commentary from a Federal Reserve official boosted confidence in the likelihood of a cut per Investopedia and gold coverage noted market focus on the Fed’s decision path. This aligns with lower Treasury yields (10Y -1.41% 7d) and today’s VIX decline (-7.04% 1d), tilting the tape risk-on. At the same time, AI-led volatility remains a headwind in the background. Recent reports highlighted tech-driven turbulence with rebounds that faltered (MarketWatch) and broader selloff concerns around AI valuations (Fortune), which maps to the still-elevated VIX over the week and month and the mixed 7d equity performance (S&P 500 -1.12%, Nasdaq -1.02%). Yahoo also framed the week as turbulent, reinforcing that today’s bounce comes after sharp losses.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% Today’s broad equity gains (S&P 500 +0.90%, Nasdaq +1.63%, Russell 2000 +1.03%), firm futures (ES +0.99%, NQ +1.78%), softer yields (10Y -0.22% 1d), and a 7.04% drop in VIX tilt the next 24h bias upward, though elevated VIX on a 7d and 30d basis keeps confidence moderate.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether tech leadership persists: Nasdaq Composite 22,636 and Nasdaq futures 24,738 need to hold gains, with QQQ at 599.51 as a proxy. Sustained breadth improvement versus today’s 12 up and 3 down profile would validate an up-bias; a reversal alongside a VIX push back above the 21.78 print would challenge it. Monitor small caps and cyclicals via Russell 2000 at 2,393.90 and Russell futures near 2,400; follow-through above 2,400 would bolster risk-on tone. In macro, keep an eye on the 10Y yield around 4.05% and the US Dollar at 100.24; continued yield softness with a stable dollar supports equities, while a jump in either could cap the rally. Energy and metals are potential swing factors: WTI around 57.98 remains soft and Gold at 4,090.90 is rebounding slightly; renewed oil weakness has tended to coincide with growth worries, while steady gold alongside lower yields is consistent with today’s calmer risk setup.
