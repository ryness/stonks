  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities finished mixed: S&P 500 -0.05% on the day (7d -0.91%), Dow 30 -0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%, while ETFs echoed the split (SPY -0.02%, QQQ +0.08%). On a weekly basis, risk appetite has faded with tech and small caps weak (Nasdaq -2.55% 7d; Russell 2000 -3.11% 7d), despite modest 30d gains in the large-cap complexes.
  
  Volatility eased day over day but remains elevated: VIX at 19.83 fell 0.85% today but is up 10.11% over 7d and 19.10% over 30d, signaling lingering caution. Equity futures were subdued to mixed, with S&P futures -0.07% 1d, Nasdaq futures essentially flat (0.00%), Dow futures -0.67%, and Russell futures +0.25%, pointing to only tentative risk-taking.
  
  Rates were a headwind intraday, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15 (30d +0.70%), while the US Dollar was marginally higher 0.09% 1d. Taken together, day-to-day risk appetite is stabilizing, but the weekly deterioration across growth and small caps alongside higher realized vol suggests a cautious tone.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market breadth was slightly negative (7 up, 8 down), and the average 1d index change was -0.05%, implying a modestly risk-off skew beneath the mixed headline moves. Volatility is still elevated even after today’s dip, with VIX at 19.83 (-0.85% 1d but +10.11% 7d), which argues for choppy conditions. The 10Y Treasury at 4.15 rose 0.88% on the day, a tightening impulse for equities. Overall health is fair but fragile, with weakness concentrated in small caps and a soft 7d profile.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps on the day: Russell 2000 was a positive standout at +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite rose +0.13% (QQQ +0.08%), while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq -2.55%), whereas the Dow was comparatively resilient at -0.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** According to the Guardian, global markets have struggled after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy, which aligns with the past week’s weakness in US growth and small caps (Nasdaq -2.55% 7d; Russell 2000 -3.11% 7d). This backdrop skews risk-off by pressuring higher-beta segments. The Guardian also noted US markets struggling amid tech valuation concerns and economic uncertainty, consistent with a higher VIX on the week (+10.11% 7d to 19.83). Elevated volatility tends to curb risk appetite, matching the S&P 500’s softer 7d move (-0.91%). Trade policy headlines were mixed but narrow in scope, with Australia welcoming the removal of US tariffs on beef and other food imports; the broader cross-asset tape showed limited response, as S&P futures fell 1.03% over 7d during the same window.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55%: Equities and futures were mixed on the day (S&P 500 -0.05%, Nasdaq +0.13%; ES -0.07%, NQ 0.00%), VIX eased 0.85% but remains elevated on the week (+10.11%), and breadth was near balanced (7 up, 8 down). Rising 10Y yields to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d) offset small rebounds in growth, while recent news flow highlights lingering tech and China-related caution, arguing for range-bound trade.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P futures versus the prior day reference around 6,760 (ES=F last 6,755.25, 1d reference 6,760.00) and whether VIX holds below the 20 handle (last 19.83); sustained moves above/below these marks would tip the intraday bias. Also track the 10Y Treasury near 4.15 and whether yields extend higher, as the day’s 0.88% rise coincided with pressure on cyclicals. Monitor leadership for confirmation of a flat, range-bound tape: QQQ holding near 608.86 (+0.08% 1d) alongside Russell futures stabilizing above 2,390 (RTY=F last 2,396.00, 1d reference 2,390.00), while Dow futures recover toward 47,547 (YM=F last 47,229.00, 1d reference 47,547.00). Cross-asset context from WTI at 60.09 (+2.39% 1d), Gold at 4,087.60 (-2.37% 1d), and the US Dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d, -0.93% 7d) will help gauge risk tone into the next session.

## 1. Pulse

Equities finished mixed: S&P 500 -0.05% on the day (7d -0.91%), Dow 30 -0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%, while ETFs echoed the split (SPY -0.02%, QQQ +0.08%). On a weekly basis, risk appetite has faded with tech and small caps weak (Nasdaq -2.55% 7d; Russell 2000 -3.11% 7d), despite modest 30d gains in the large-cap complexes.

Volatility eased day over day but remains elevated: VIX at 19.83 fell 0.85% today but is up 10.11% over 7d and 19.10% over 30d, signaling lingering caution. Equity futures were subdued to mixed, with S&P futures -0.07% 1d, Nasdaq futures essentially flat (0.00%), Dow futures -0.67%, and Russell futures +0.25%, pointing to only tentative risk-taking.

Rates were a headwind intraday, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15 (30d +0.70%), while the US Dollar was marginally higher 0.09% 1d. Taken together, day-to-day risk appetite is stabilizing, but the weekly deterioration across growth and small caps alongside higher realized vol suggests a cautious tone.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market breadth was slightly negative (7 up, 8 down), and the average 1d index change was -0.05%, implying a modestly risk-off skew beneath the mixed headline moves. Volatility is still elevated even after today’s dip, with VIX at 19.83 (-0.85% 1d but +10.11% 7d), which argues for choppy conditions. The 10Y Treasury at 4.15 rose 0.88% on the day, a tightening impulse for equities. Overall health is fair but fragile, with weakness concentrated in small caps and a soft 7d profile.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps on the day: Russell 2000 was a positive standout at +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite rose +0.13% (QQQ +0.08%), while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq -2.55%), whereas the Dow was comparatively resilient at -0.35%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** According to the Guardian, global markets have struggled after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy, which aligns with the past week’s weakness in US growth and small caps (Nasdaq -2.55% 7d; Russell 2000 -3.11% 7d). This backdrop skews risk-off by pressuring higher-beta segments. The Guardian also noted US markets struggling amid tech valuation concerns and economic uncertainty, consistent with a higher VIX on the week (+10.11% 7d to 19.83). Elevated volatility tends to curb risk appetite, matching the S&P 500’s softer 7d move (-0.91%). Trade policy headlines were mixed but narrow in scope, with Australia welcoming the removal of US tariffs on beef and other food imports; the broader cross-asset tape showed limited response, as S&P futures fell 1.03% over 7d during the same window.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55%: Equities and futures were mixed on the day (S&P 500 -0.05%, Nasdaq +0.13%; ES -0.07%, NQ 0.00%), VIX eased 0.85% but remains elevated on the week (+10.11%), and breadth was near balanced (7 up, 8 down). Rising 10Y yields to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d) offset small rebounds in growth, while recent news flow highlights lingering tech and China-related caution, arguing for range-bound trade.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P futures versus the prior day reference around 6,760 (ES=F last 6,755.25, 1d reference 6,760.00) and whether VIX holds below the 20 handle (last 19.83); sustained moves above/below these marks would tip the intraday bias. Also track the 10Y Treasury near 4.15 and whether yields extend higher, as the day’s 0.88% rise coincided with pressure on cyclicals. Monitor leadership for confirmation of a flat, range-bound tape: QQQ holding near 608.86 (+0.08% 1d) alongside Russell futures stabilizing above 2,390 (RTY=F last 2,396.00, 1d reference 2,390.00), while Dow futures recover toward 47,547 (YM=F last 47,229.00, 1d reference 47,547.00). Cross-asset context from WTI at 60.09 (+2.39% 1d), Gold at 4,087.60 (-2.37% 1d), and the US Dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d, -0.93% 7d) will help gauge risk tone into the next session.
