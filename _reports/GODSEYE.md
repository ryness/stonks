  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone, with all major US benchmarks up between roughly 0.5% and 1.0% on the day. The S&P 500 gained 0.65% and set a new record high, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.81%, and small caps outperformed modestly with the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the Dow added 0.48%. Average 1d index performance across the board is about 0.73%, and 13 of 15 tracked assets are higher, signaling broad-based risk appetite rather than a narrow melt-up.","Volatility and futures confirm improving sentiment. The VIX dropped 6.2% on the day to 14.49 and is down 21.9% over 30 days, consistent with a sustained compression in equity risk premia, even as the 10Y Treasury yield dipped slightly by 0.29% on the day but remains about 4.2% above levels 30 days ago. Equity futures mirror the cash move, with S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts all higher 0.47%-0.98% on the day and 0.87%-4.73% over the week, showing that risk appetite is not only intact but has been steadily improving over the past month.","Cross-asset signals are mixed but skew risk-on. Gold futures are up 1.15% on the day and 8.74% over 30 days, and WTI crude has risen 2.35% on the day and just over 2% over both 7 and 30 days, pointing to underlying macro growth and some hedging demand. The US dollar index is modestly stronger on the day (+0.21%) and over the week (+0.91%) as Fed rate cut expectations recede, but the combination of higher equities, lower spot volatility, and strong breadth indicates that, for now, improving risk appetite is overpowering tighter rate and stronger-dollar headwinds."
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on the benchmark moves. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1d index gain sits at about 0.73%, suggesting a broad advance rather than a narrow rally. The VIX at 14.49 and down more than 6% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days signals a calm volatility backdrop, while the 10Y yield near 4.17%, slightly lower on the day but up 4.2% over a month, indicates tighter but not disorderly financial conditions. Taken together, the market appears healthy, with risk being added in an environment of controlled volatility and gradually higher rates.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from growth and small caps, with QQQ up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 higher by 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.81%. Over the week, the Russell 2000 and Russell futures stand out with gains of 4.94% and 4.73%, respectively, signaling strong risk-on appetite down the cap spectrum. On the laggard side for the day, the Dow is the softest major index at +0.48%, and the US Dollar, while still positive at +0.21% on the day, is negative over 30 days (-0.52%), showing that cyclicals and smaller names are outpacing the older large-cap value complex. Over the week, the 10Y Treasury is up 0.99%, working as a mild headwind to duration-sensitive areas even as equities grind higher.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro optimism around the US economy is a primary driver, with the S&P 500 rallying to a new record high on US economic optimism and a strong growth backdrop. Headlines point to resilient GDP growth and solid jobs data that have supported risk-on positioning, evidenced by broad equity gains and higher small caps, while simultaneously lifting the US dollar by 0.91% over the week as the market pares back aggressive Fed rate-cut expectations. This combination is generally risk-on for equities in the near term but raises medium-term valuation and rate-sensitivity questions as the 10Y yield has climbed 4.2% over 30 days.","Monetary policy expectations and Fed-related rate repricing are another key theme, with reports emphasizing that a mixed payrolls print has reduced near-term Fed cut bets and pushed the dollar to a one-month high. The slight 0.29% decline in the 10Y yield today suggests some relief, but the upward trend in yields over the last month is consistent with markets shifting from aggressive easing hopes to a "higher for longer" stance. This is risk-off for long-duration assets in theory, yet current tape action shows that equity markets are treating it as a sign of economic resilience rather than imminent policy tightening, supporting a near-term risk-on bias.","Geopolitical and policy risk remains in the background but has not derailed the current rally. Coverage around the potential Supreme Court ruling on US tariffs and tensions tied to Venezuela and broader trade policy underscores an overhang that could flip sentiment if outcomes are adverse to growth. For now, however, the strong performance in cyclicals, small caps, and commodities like WTI crude (+2.35% on the day) suggests that these risks are being discounted, and the prevailing impact on the tape is muted and skewed toward risk-on positioning rather than de-risking."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key triggers in the next 24 hours include the anticipated US Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariff powers, which could materially shift sentiment toward risk-on if tariffs are curtailed or risk-off if broad powers are upheld and trade tensions escalate. Markets will also be sensitive to any follow-up commentary on the recent US jobs report and Fed policy outlook, as prior headlines note that payrolls data helped cement expectations that the Fed will not cut soon, influencing both the dollar and rates. Additionally, Asia-Pacific trading and China's inflation data, flagged as a focus in the overnight futures coverage, could shape global risk sentiment and spill over into US equities and commodities, particularly if Chinese demand signals surprise meaningfully relative to expectations.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity gains today (average index +0.73%), strong breadth (13 up vs. 2 down), and confirming strength in futures with all major contracts higher 0.47%-0.98% on the day. The VIX down 6.2% to 14.49 and a new record high in the S&P 500 point to constructive risk appetite, while only a slight dip in the 10Y yield suggests stable macro conditions rather than a growth scare. The main caveat is event risk from the pending Supreme Court tariff ruling and ongoing recalibration of Fed cut expectations, which tempers confidence from higher levels but does not yet outweigh the current risk-on tape.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch how S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures trade relative to today's closes around 7,005 for ES and 25,938 for NQ, as holding or building on these 0.6%-1.0% daily gains would validate the expected upside bias. Close attention to small caps via the Russell 2000 cash index at 2,624 and Russell futures at 2,637 is warranted, since they have been the weekly leaders with roughly 4.9%-4.7% gains; continued outperformance there would confirm a durable risk-on rotation rather than a narrow mega-cap move. Monitoring the VIX around the mid-teens is also key: sustaining levels near or below 15 after a 6.2% daily drop would signal that dip-buyers remain comfortable with exposure into event risk.","On the macro and policy front, traders should focus on headlines around the Supreme Court's tariff case and any follow-up analysis on the recent US jobs report's implications for Fed policy, given their documented impact on the dollar and rate-cut expectations. Moves in the 10Y yield around 4.17% will be critical; a push meaningfully higher would challenge growth and high-duration sectors, while stability or a modest drift lower would support the current equity bid. Overseas, the Asia-Pacific session and China inflation data could influence commodities such as WTI crude, already up 2.35% on the day, and risk proxies more broadly, potentially reinforcing or moderating the prevailing risk-on tone into the next US session."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone, with all major US benchmarks up between roughly 0.5% and 1.0% on the day. The S&P 500 gained 0.65% and set a new record high, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.81%, and small caps outperformed modestly with the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the Dow added 0.48%. Average 1d index performance across the board is about 0.73%, and 13 of 15 tracked assets are higher, signaling broad-based risk appetite rather than a narrow melt-up.","Volatility and futures confirm improving sentiment. The VIX dropped 6.2% on the day to 14.49 and is down 21.9% over 30 days, consistent with a sustained compression in equity risk premia, even as the 10Y Treasury yield dipped slightly by 0.29% on the day but remains about 4.2% above levels 30 days ago. Equity futures mirror the cash move, with S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts all higher 0.47%-0.98% on the day and 0.87%-4.73% over the week, showing that risk appetite is not only intact but has been steadily improving over the past month.","Cross-asset signals are mixed but skew risk-on.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on the benchmark moves. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1d index gain sits at about 0.73%, suggesting a broad advance rather than a narrow rally. The VIX at 14.49 and down more than 6% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days signals a calm volatility backdrop, while the 10Y yield near 4.17%, slightly lower on the day but up 4.2% over a month, indicates tighter but not disorderly financial conditions. Taken together, the market appears healthy, with risk being added in an environment of controlled volatility and gradually higher rates.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from growth and small caps, with QQQ up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 higher by 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.81%. Over the week, the Russell 2000 and Russell futures stand out with gains of 4.94% and 4.73%, respectively, signaling strong risk-on appetite down the cap spectrum. On the laggard side for the day, the Dow is the softest major index at +0.48%, and the US Dollar, while still positive at +0.21% on the day, is negative over 30 days (-0.52%), showing that cyclicals and smaller names are outpacing the older large-cap value complex. Over the week, the 10Y Treasury is up 0.99%, working as a mild headwind to duration-sensitive areas even as equities grind higher.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro optimism around the US economy is a primary driver, with the S&P 500 rallying to a new record high on US economic optimism and a strong growth backdrop. Headlines point to resilient GDP growth and solid jobs data that have supported risk-on positioning, evidenced by broad equity gains and higher small caps, while simultaneously lifting the US dollar by 0.91% over the week as the market pares back aggressive Fed rate-cut expectations.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key triggers in the next 24 hours include the anticipated US Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariff powers, which could materially shift sentiment toward risk-on if tariffs are curtailed or risk-off if broad powers are upheld and trade tensions escalate. Markets will also be sensitive to any follow-up commentary on the recent US jobs report and Fed policy outlook, as prior headlines note that payrolls data helped cement expectations that the Fed will not cut soon, influencing both the dollar and rates. Additionally, Asia-Pacific trading and China's inflation data, flagged as a focus in the overnight futures coverage, could shape global risk sentiment and spill over into US equities and commodities, particularly if Chinese demand signals surprise meaningfully relative to expectations.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity gains today (average index +0.73%), strong breadth (13 up vs. 2 down), and confirming strength in futures with all major contracts higher 0.47%-0.98% on the day. The VIX down 6.2% to 14.49 and a new record high in the S&P 500 point to constructive risk appetite, while only a slight dip in the 10Y yield suggests stable macro conditions rather than a growth scare. The main caveat is event risk from the pending Supreme Court tariff ruling and ongoing recalibration of Fed cut expectations, which tempers confidence from higher levels but does not yet outweigh the current risk-on tape.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch how S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures trade relative to today's closes around 7,005 for ES and 25,938 for NQ, as holding or building on these 0.6%-1.0% daily gains would validate the expected upside bias. Close attention to small caps via the Russell 2000 cash index at 2,624 and Russell futures at 2,637 is warranted, since they have been the weekly leaders with roughly 4.9%-4.7% gains; continued outperformance there would confirm a durable risk-on rotation rather than a narrow mega-cap move. Monitoring the VIX around the mid-teens is also key: sustaining levels near or below 15 after a 6.2% daily drop would signal that dip-buyers remain comfortable with exposure into event risk.","On the macro and policy front, traders should focus on headlines around the Supreme Court's tariff case and any follow-up analysis on the recent US jobs report's implications for Fed policy, given their documented impact on the dollar and rate-cut expectations. Moves in the 10Y yield around 4.17% will be critical; a push meaningfully higher would challenge growth and high-duration sectors, while stability or a modest drift lower would support the current equity bid. Overseas, the Asia-Pacific session and China inflation data could influence commodities such as WTI crude, already up 2.35% on the day, and risk proxies more broadly, potentially reinforcing or moderating the prevailing risk-on tone into the next US session."]

LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone, with all major US benchmarks up between roughly 0.5% and 1.0% on the day.
