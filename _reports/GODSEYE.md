  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite faded notably as equities sold off broadly: S&P 500 fell 1.66%, Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.29%, and Russell 2000 sank 2.77% (Dow 30 -1.65%). Breadth was weak (3 up, 12 down) with the average index change at -2.01%, signaling a distribution day rather than rotation within equities.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm the risk-off tone. VIX jumped 14.22% to 20.00 on the day (up 20.26% over 30d), while S&P futures slid 1.84%, Nasdaq futures -2.39%, and Russell futures -2.91% into the next session; Dow futures were roughly flat (-0.03%). This combination points to higher hedging demand and softer risk-taking ahead.
  
  Rates added pressure, with the 10Y Treasury yield up 1.16% on the day to 4.11%. Commodities were mixed: WTI crude rose 1.64% while gold was near flat on the day (-0.20%) but strong over the week (+6.29%), consistent with a defensive bid as equities and growth proxies weakened.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is fragile. Breadth skewed negative (3 up vs 12 down) and the average index fell 2.01%, indicating broad selling rather than isolated weakness. Volatility rose sharply (VIX +14.22% to 20.00) and the 10Y yield climbed to 4.11% (+1.16% 1d), a backdrop that typically pressures equities. Together, these point to a cautious tape with elevated downside sensitivity.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership turned defensive: WTI Crude was a rare positive standout on the day at +1.64%, while small caps led the declines with the Russell 2000 down 2.77% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.29%. Over the week, the Dow 30 is the relative leader at +0.79%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-2.05%) and Russell 2000 (-1.83%) lag.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Headlines tied to the U.S. government reopening and rotation after AI-led gains are influencing risk. Reports noted futures dipping amid rotation following the Dow’s surge to new highs, with earlier optimism around ending the shutdown and strong AMD outlook providing support; today’s weakness in the Nasdaq and QQQ (Nasdaq -2.29%, QQQ -2.04%) signals that tech leadership is under pressure and tilting risk-off. Energy and defensive flows are also shaping the tape. Oil firmed on shutdown hopes and fuel strength (WTI +1.64%), suggesting pockets of support in energy even as broader equities fell. At the same time, gold’s strong 7-day gain (+6.29%) alongside crypto ETF outflows on macro jitters underscores a defensive bias, consistent with higher VIX and rising Treasury yields.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Developments around the U.S. government reopening are a key near-term policy catalyst cited by multiple reports and could sway risk sentiment. Regionally, India’s Infosys buyback record date on Nov 14 is on the calendar and may influence local flows; broader risk tone could also react to additional oil market updates given recent headlines tying crude strength to policy and supply dynamics.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 65% — Broad 1-day equity declines (S&P -1.66%, Nasdaq -2.29%, Russell -2.77%), higher VIX (+14.22% to 20.00), weaker futures into the next session (ES -1.84%, NQ -2.39%, RTY -2.91%), and a 10Y yield uptick (+1.16% to 4.11%) skew the near-term bias lower despite earlier shutdown optimism.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch futures and volatility: ES ~6,749, NQ ~25,011, and RTY ~2,388 alongside VIX at 20.00. Sustained weakness in NQ/RTY while VIX holds 20 or higher and the 10Y remains near 4.11% would confirm ongoing risk aversion. Focus on sector and style leadership: small caps (Russell 2000 last 2,382.98) and tech (QQQ last 608.40) underperformed; continued lag there versus the Dow could keep breadth negative. Monitor SPY (672.04) for signs of stabilization versus continued distribution. Track macro cues consistent with the move: WTI crude (59.65, +1.64% 1d) resilience versus gold strength over the week (4,196.00, +6.29% 7d) can signal persistent defensiveness. Headlines around the U.S. government reopening remain a key swing factor for sentiment.
