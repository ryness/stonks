  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Equities are trading with a constructive, risk-on tone. All major U.S. benchmarks are green on the day, with the S&P 500 up about 0.65%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.81%, Dow up 0.48%, and small caps (Russell 2000) stronger at 0.78%. Over the past week, the Russell 2000 is up 4.94% and the Dow 2.35%, signaling broad participation and some catch-up in cyclicals and domestics, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq grind higher ~1% each.",
      "Volatility and futures confirm improving risk appetite. The VIX is down 6.2% on the day to 14.49 and nearly 22% lower over 30 days, while S&P and Nasdaq futures are up 0.62% and 0.98% on the day and more than 3% over 30 days. This combination of rising equities and falling implied volatility indicates investors are adding risk rather than hedging it.",
      "Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive rather than restrictive for equities in the very near term. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially stable to slightly lower on the day at 4.17% (-0.29% 1d) despite being up 4.2% over 30 days, suggesting no fresh rates shock today. At the same time, risk hedges and macro assets like gold (+0.91% 1d, +8.48% 30d) and crude (+2.35% 1d) are firm, showing active macro positioning but not yet derailing the equity risk-on tone."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on today's benchmark moves. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average index-level 1d change is a robust +0.73%. A 6.2% drop in the VIX to 14.49 alongside a flat-to-softer 10-year yield at 4.17% points to a benign volatility and rates backdrop for now. Taken together, the tape reflects a healthy, pro-risk configuration rather than a narrow or defensive advance.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and small caps, with the QQQ ETF up 1.00% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while the S&P 500 and SPY trail modestly at about 0.65–0.66%. The Russell 2000 and Russell futures are also clear standouts on the week, gaining 4.94% and 4.73% respectively. On the lagging side today, the Dow 30 is the weakest major equity index at +0.48% and the Dow futures are up only 0.47%. Within macro assets, the US Dollar is a mild positive at +0.20% 1d, whereas the only real underperformer is the volatility complex, with VIX down 6.21% on the day.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "Macro data and Fed expectations are central drivers of today's risk-on tape. News flow highlights that recent U.S. jobs data have helped "seal" rate bets, with markets leaning toward the Federal Reserve holding off on immediate cuts but not tightening further, which reduces near-term policy uncertainty and supports equities. Mixed but not alarming economic data, as cited in Asian market coverage, are influencing Fed cut expectations while allowing U.S. bonds to hold gains, a backdrop that is consistent with modestly lower yields today and supportive of equity risk-taking.",
      "Trade policy and the pending Supreme Court case on Trump's tariffs are another key macro theme. Multiple reports point to a "triple-threat" volatility setup around fresh jobs data, a potential SCOTUS tariff ruling, and Fed comments, and separate coverage underscores that the Court's decision could meaningfully alter tariff powers and fiscal room. The Supreme Court did not issue a ruling today in the tariffs case, removing an immediate binary shock and keeping risk appetite intact for now, but the prospect of a future ruling still hangs over trade-sensitive sectors and keeps some optionality priced into the tape.",
      "Geopolitics and global risk sentiment remain present but are not dominating intraday U.S. price action. Prior headlines note that Asian stocks have faded from recent highs even as U.S. Treasuries hold gains, highlighting some global growth and geopolitical worries, including Venezuela-related tensions that previously supported energy and defense stocks. With WTI crude up 2.35% on the day and gold up 0.91%, markets are still hedging geopolitical and macro uncertainty, but U.S. indices moving higher alongside these hedges suggests the current impact is more risk-tilt and sectoral (energy, defenses, commodities) than outright risk-off."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours center on U.S. policy and global data. Markets are focused on any follow-up from the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the Trump tariffs case, with a ruling potentially swinging trade-sensitive equities and yields. Fed-related commentary tied to the recent jobs report remains in focus, as investors gauge how firmly rate-cut expectations are being repriced. Abroad, Asia traders are watching China inflation data, which could influence global risk sentiment and commodities and spill over into U.S. futures.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly higher given synchronized gains across major U.S. indices (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%), supportive futures (S&P and Nasdaq futures up 0.62% and 0.98%), and a 6.21% drop in VIX to 14.49. Breadth is broadly positive (13 up vs 2 down) and the 10-year yield is slightly lower on the day, indicating no fresh rates shock. While pending catalysts like the unresolved SCOTUS tariff ruling and ongoing Fed communication could inject volatility, the current configuration of strong equity momentum, subdued implied volatility, and stable rates tilts the next 24-hour bias to the upside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Traders should watch equity index futures overnight—particularly S&P (around 7,005) and Nasdaq futures (25,938)—for confirmation that today's positive momentum persists. If these contracts can hold or build on their roughly 0.6–1.0% daily gains while the VIX remains anchored near 14.5 or lower, it would be consistent with the projected upward bias. Any sharp reversal in futures alongside a snapback higher in VIX would be an early warning that event risk around tariffs or Fed commentary is being repriced.",
      "On the sector and style front, monitoring small caps and growth proxies will be important, as they have been leading the tape. The Russell 2000 at 2,624 and Russell futures at about 2,637 are outperforming on both 1d and 7d horizons, while QQQ is up 1.00% on the day and over 3% in 30 days; sustained leadership here would support a continued risk-on move. At the same time, elevated moves in macro assets like WTI crude (59.12, +2.35% on the day) and gold (4,490.30, +0.91% 1d, +8.48% 30d) should be watched for signs that geopolitical or inflation concerns are intensifying enough to challenge the current equity-friendly backdrop.",
      "Macro prints and policy headlines are the other critical watchpoints into the next session. Any update or leak regarding the Supreme Court's Trump tariffs ruling could quickly affect cyclicals, exporters, and overall risk sentiment, while additional Fed-related commentary in the wake of jobs data may shift the path of the 10-year yield from its current 4.17% level. Traders should track how the 10-year trades relative to 4.2%—a stable-to-softer yield would validate the current bid in equities, whereas an abrupt move higher in yields paired with renewed VIX strength would argue for fading the upside bias."

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on today's benchmark moves. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average index-level 1d change is a robust +0.73%. A 6.2% drop in the VIX to 14.49 alongside a flat-to-softer 10-year yield at 4.17% points to a benign volatility and rates backdrop for now.

Abroad, Asia traders are watching China inflation data, which could influence global risk sentiment and commodities and spill over into U.S. futures.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly higher given synchronized gains across major U.S. indices (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%), supportive futures (S&P and Nasdaq futures up 0.62% and 0.98%), and a 6.21% drop in VIX to 14.49. Breadth is broadly positive (13 up vs 2 down) and the 10-year yield is slightly lower on the day, indicating no fresh rates shock. While pending catalysts like the unresolved SCOTUS tariff ruling and ongoing Fed communication could inject volatility, the current configuration of strong equity momentum, subdued implied volatility, and stable rates tilts the next 24-hour bias to the upside.

3.2. **Watch List:** [
    "Traders should watch equity index futures overnight—particularly S&P (around 7,005) and Nasdaq futures (25,938)—for confirmation that today's positive momentum persists. If these contracts can hold or build on their roughly 0.6–1.0% daily gains while the VIX remains anchored near 14.5 or lower, it would be consistent with the projected upward bias.

    "Macro prints and policy headlines are the other critical watchpoints into the next session. Any update or leak regarding the Supreme Court's Trump tariffs ruling could quickly affect cyclicals, exporters, and overall risk sentiment, while additional Fed-related commentary in the wake of jobs data may shift the path of the 10-year yield from its current 4.17% level.
