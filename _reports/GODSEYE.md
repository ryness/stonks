  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities were mixed with a slight negative skew: the S&P 500 fell 0.05% and the Dow 30 lost 0.65%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 added 0.22%. Breadth across tracked benchmarks was 9 up vs 6 down and the average 1-day index change was -0.05%, signaling only marginal deterioration rather than a broad risk-on reversal.
  
  Volatility eased on the day but remains elevated: VIX slipped 0.85% to 19.83, yet is up 10.11% over 7 days and 19.10% over 30 days. That profile points to fading risk appetite on a weekly horizon despite today’s modest calm.
  
  Futures and rates underscore a tentative tone: S&P (+0.08%), Nasdaq (+0.21%), and Russell (+0.38%) futures firmed, but Dow futures lagged (-0.58%), while the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% to 4.15. Taken together, risk appetite is stabilizing intraday but has weakened over the past week.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious-neutral. Breadth was slightly positive (9 up, 6 down), yet the average 1-day index move was a small decline (-0.05%), reflecting only a mild negative tilt. Volatility is still elevated even after a 0.85% 1-day dip in VIX to 19.83, and the 10Y yield’s 0.88% rise to 4.15 tightens financial conditions. Overall, the mix points to a market digesting recent weakness rather than a decisive risk-on shift.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership was mixed: small caps outperformed on the day with the Russell 2000 up 0.22%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65% 1d. Over the week, small caps and growth have underperformed (Russell 2000 -3.11% 7d; Nasdaq Composite -2.55% 7d; QQQ -2.31% 7d), whereas the Dow has been relatively resilient (-0.35% 7d).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Hawkish Federal Reserve commentary has tempered hopes for a December rate cut, pressuring equities and lifting yields, as highlighted by reports noting a global equity pullback alongside rising U.S. Treasury yields. This aligns with the 10Y Treasury rising 0.88% on the day to 4.15 and a weekly uptick in VIX (+10.11%), reinforcing a risk-off impulse and the S&P 500’s 7-day decline of 0.91%. A tech-led retreat remains a theme, with coverage of a deepening tech selloff spilling into Asia and weighing on growth sentiment. This maps to the Nasdaq Composite’s -2.55% 7-day and Nasdaq futures’ -2.33% 7-day moves, indicating ongoing pressure on higher-beta growth exposures (risk-off) despite a modest 1-day rebound in Nasdaq (+0.13%) and NQ futures (+0.21%). Energy dynamics added a wrinkle as WTI crude rose 2.15% on the day, with reports citing strong fuel premiums and supply concerns, which can support inflation expectations and rates. That combination coincides with higher yields and a 2.45% 1-day drop in gold, a pattern that tends to restrain risk appetite for duration-heavy assets.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% – Mixed signals prevail: modestly positive S&P/Nasdaq/Russell futures, slightly lower VIX on the day, and a narrow average 1-day index decline (-0.05%) countered by higher 10Y yields (+0.88% to 4.15) and weak 7-day performance (e.g., Nasdaq -2.55%, Russell -3.11%), suggesting consolidation rather than a directional break.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P 500 futures around 6,760–6,825 (last 6,765.25; the 7-day reference was 6,825.25) and the VIX near the 20 handle (last 19.83) for signs of either renewed pressure or intraday stabilization consistent with a flat tape. Track the 10Y yield around 4.15 and WTI near $60, as further yield strength or oil upside could cap equity bounces. Monitor leadership dispersion: small caps (Russell 2000 last 2,388.23; RTY futures last 2,399.00) versus the Dow (YM futures last 47,271.00) and growth proxies like QQQ (last 608.86). If Nasdaq futures hold above 25,147.50 while VIX stays sub-20 and the dollar remains subdued on the week (DXY 7d -0.93%), choppy, range-bound trading is more likely into the next session.
