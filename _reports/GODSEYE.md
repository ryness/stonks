  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities finished mixed with a cyclical tilt: the Dow 30 rose 1.18%, the S&P 500 gained 0.21%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.25% and the Russell 2000 added 0.11%. Breadth was positive at 9 up vs 6 down and the average index change was +0.20%, indicating risk appetite is improving but uneven across styles, with megacap growth lagging.
  
  Volatility eased as the VIX fell 1.82% to 17.28, consistent with a modest risk-on tone. Futures echoed the rotation, with S&P futures up 0.32% and Dow futures up 1.21% versus Nasdaq futures essentially flat at -0.04% and Russell futures at -0.03%, signaling stronger demand for cyclicals than for growth.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals were mixed: the 10Y Treasury yield edged up 1 bp (+0.24%) to 4.12, the US Dollar dipped 0.09%, gold rose 0.61%, and WTI crude climbed 1.25%. Overall, risk appetite is improving versus last week’s stress, but the bid to gold and slight yield rise temper the risk-on message.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive. Breadth skewed positive (9 up, 6 down) and the average index change was +0.20%, led by the Dow’s +1.18% while the Nasdaq slipped 0.25%. A 1.82% drop in VIX to 17.28 supports a calmer backdrop, and the 10Y yield is only modestly higher on the day at 4.12% while still down over 30 days (-0.68%). Together, this points to an improving but uneven tape favoring cyclicals over growth.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership favored the Dow 30 on the day (+1.18%) while the Nasdaq Composite lagged (-0.25%). Over the past week, the Dow (+0.77%) outperformed, whereas the Nasdaq (-1.08%) and Russell 2000 (-0.85%) underperformed, reinforcing the rotation away from growth and small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Progress toward ending the US government shutdown supported risk sentiment. Headlines noted pre-market strength tied to shutdown resolution hopes and a Senate procedural step on a short-term funding deal, which aligned with stronger cyclicals and energy tone (Dow futures +1.21%, WTI +1.25%). This is a clear risk-on catalyst as funding clarity reduces policy uncertainty. At the same time, recent coverage highlighted tech valuation concerns and the prior worst tech sell-off since April, which is consistent with ongoing growth underperformance today (Nasdaq -0.25%, Nasdaq futures -1.15% over 7d). This dynamic acts as a risk-off counterweight within tech, helping explain the rotation toward the Dow despite the broader calming in volatility.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Potential Congressional votes or announcements on a short-term funding deal to end the US government shutdown could be the primary market mover, likely risk-on if a resolution is confirmed. Oil market reports flagged by recent coverage as key to assessing surplus conditions may also sway crude; a swing in WTI could influence energy equities and broader cyclicals.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 58% — The balance of evidence leans modestly higher: breadth was positive, VIX fell 1.82% to 17.28, and cyclicals outperformed with the Dow +1.18% and Dow futures +1.21%, aided by shutdown resolution hopes. Offsetting factors are tech softness (Nasdaq -0.25%, NQ -1.15% over 7d) and a slight uptick in the 10Y to 4.12%, keeping confidence moderate.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Policy headlines around the US funding deal are pivotal; watch whether S&P futures (6,879) and Dow futures (48,035) can hold gains on any confirmation of a shutdown resolution. If headlines stall, monitor the VIX around 17.28 for any re-acceleration as a warning signal. Keep an eye on the growth–cyclical split: Nasdaq futures near 25,704 and QQQ’s -0.27% day show lingering pressure on tech, while SPY was up 0.23%. Also track the 10Y yield at 4.12; further upside could maintain headwinds for duration-sensitive growth. Watch commodities for sector read-through: WTI at 60.88 rose 1.25% and could buoy cyclicals if strength persists, while gold at 4,136.8 up 0.61% signals residual caution. USD softness (99.53, -0.09%) provides a mild tailwind to risk if it continues.
