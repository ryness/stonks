  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across major U.S. equities, the tone is mildly risk-off in cash markets but improving in futures. The S&P 500 fell 0.24% on the day and is down 1.02% over 7d, while the Dow dropped 0.62% and the Russell 2000 slid 0.45%, pointing to broad but modest pressure. The Nasdaq Composite was the outlier with a 0.23% gain, though it remains weaker on a 7d (-1.98%) and 30d (-3.03%) basis, indicating that recent tech softness has not fully reversed and risk appetite over the past week has faded slightly.
  
  Overnight futures paint a somewhat brighter picture, suggesting a tentative rebound in risk appetite. S&P futures are up 0.70% and Nasdaq futures up 0.75%, with Dow futures higher by 0.63%, while Russell futures are nearly flat at -0.10%, implying leadership from large-cap and growth exposures rather than small caps. The average 1d index change of -0.19% combined with 8 up vs 7 down issues shows mixed but not stressed conditions, consistent with a market that is cautious rather than capitulating.
  
  Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of a controlled risk environment. The VIX is essentially flat on the day (-0.12%) at 16.48, a relatively low level, though it is up 6.94% over 7d, reflecting some incremental hedging as equities softened. The 10Y Treasury yield eased 0.79% on the day to 4.15% after edging higher over 7d and 30d, signaling a small bid for safety but not a major flight to quality. Overall, risk appetite has cooled over the past week but is stabilizing with today's futures bounce and contained volatility.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral to slightly soft based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is nearly balanced (8 up, 7 down), and the average 1d index move of about -0.19% points to mild, not severe, selling pressure. The VIX sitting near 16.5 and barely changed on the day suggests no significant stress in volatility markets. A small drop in the 10Y yield to 4.15% alongside modest equity declines indicates cautious positioning ahead of data rather than a disorderly risk-off move.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On a 1d basis, the Nasdaq Composite is a positive standout, rising 0.23%, with its proxy QQQ up 0.20%, while Dow-linked assets lag, with the Dow 30 down 0.62%. Over the last week, Dow benchmarks are comparatively resilient (Dow 30 +0.33%, Dow futures +1.34%) versus tech, as QQQ is down 2.20% and the Nasdaq Composite is off 1.98%. The Russell 2000 is mixed, down 0.45% on the day but roughly flat over 7d (-0.09%), highlighting that small caps are not leading in either direction. Overall, large-cap value/cyclicals tied to the Dow have led on the week, while growth/tech and the Nasdaq have been the primary laggards.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** The dominant macro theme driving the tape is anticipation of key U.S. economic data, particularly jobs and inflation releases that will shape the interest-rate outlook. Multiple headlines highlight that global and U.S. markets have dipped as investors wait for a busy data week, with references to a delayed U.S. jobs report seen as pivotal for the path of rates. This has produced a cautious, event-driven tone consistent with slightly weaker global and U.S. equity benchmarks and a small bid into Treasuries, tilting the near-term bias modestly risk-off until data arrive. Another important driver is global central bank and policy uncertainty, including upcoming Bank of Japan decisions and trade negotiations. Asian stocks, including Japan's Nikkei, fell around 1% amid losses in AI and chip-related names, with investors explicitly cited as cautious ahead of U.S. employment data and the BoJ policy decision. Separately, Indian equities are under pressure on renewed uncertainty around a U.S. trade deal, with foreign investors selling and the rupee weakening. These developments support a global de-risking tone, especially in more cyclical and export-sensitive markets, which feeds into softer risk appetite and explains why non-U.S. benchmarks are leaning risk-off. Finally, there is a broader global risk context involving crypto and commodities that reinforces the mixed risk picture. Crypto coverage points to range-bound expectations around the FOMC meeting and modest pressure in digital assets, aligning with a wider theme of investors awaiting clearer policy signals before adding risk. At the same time, gold futures have rallied strongly (+1.37% 1d, +10.53% 30d), while WTI crude is down sharply over 7d and 30d despite a 1.27% daily bounce, suggesting a preference for perceived defensive stores of value over growth-sensitive commodities. Together, these macro and geopolitical drivers underpin a cautious, data-dependent tape with a slight defensive tilt.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the key potential market movers are U.S. economic data releases, especially the delayed November jobs report and other labor and inflation prints referenced in the headlines. These reports are framed as pivotal for the interest-rate path, so stronger-than-expected data could pressure equities via higher rate expectations, while weaker data could support a bid in duration and potentially lift growth stocks. In Asia, the upcoming Bank of Japan policy decision later in the week is already influencing positioning; any BOJ-related headlines or leaks in the next day could move yen-sensitive and global risk assets. Additionally, ongoing news around U.S. trade deal uncertainty with India may impact EM sentiment and global risk appetite at the margin.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%: The modest 1d declines in major U.S. indices (S&P 500 -0.24%, Dow -0.62%, Russell 2000 -0.45%) are contrasted by a clear positive move in U.S. futures, with S&P futures up 0.70%, Nasdaq futures up 0.75%, and Dow futures up 0.63%, indicating buyers stepping in overnight. Volatility is contained with VIX flat and the 10Y yield slightly lower, suggesting no acute risk-off shock and room for a relief bounce into key data. While the past week has seen risk appetite fade (e.g., Nasdaq -1.98% 7d, VIX +6.94% 7d), the current setup points to a mildly constructive bias into the next session as markets anticipate clarity from upcoming macro releases.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch how index futures translate into cash market levels for the S&P 500 around 6,800, the Dow near 48,000, and the Nasdaq Composite just above 23,000. The overnight strength in S&P and Nasdaq futures versus flat-to-soft Russell futures underscores a continued large-cap and growth tilt; sustained leadership there would support the expected mild upward bias. Monitoring the VIX near 16.5 is key: a move lower would validate a risk-on tone, while a reversal higher would signal renewed hedging ahead of data. Macro-wise, attention should remain squarely on the U.S. jobs and inflation releases flagged in the news as central to the rate outlook, alongside any updates on central bank decision-making, particularly from the Bank of Japan. Traders should also track the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15% for confirmation: a stable or slightly lower yield would be consistent with a constructive equity open, while a sharp back-up in yields could cap upside. In cross-asset space, continued strength in gold and the U.S. dollar's short-term direction may provide additional clues on risk appetite and whether today's futures-led bounce can extend through the next session.

## 1. Pulse

Across major U.S. equities, the tone is mildly risk-off in cash markets but improving in futures. The S&P 500 fell 0.24% on the day and is down 1.02% over 7d, while the Dow dropped 0.62% and the Russell 2000 slid 0.45%, pointing to broad but modest pressure. The Nasdaq Composite was the outlier with a 0.23% gain, though it remains weaker on a 7d (-1.98%) and 30d (-3.03%) basis, indicating that recent tech softness has not fully reversed and risk appetite over the past week has faded slightly.

Overnight futures paint a somewhat brighter picture, suggesting a tentative rebound in risk appetite. S&P futures are up 0.70% and Nasdaq futures up 0.75%, with Dow futures higher by 0.63%, while Russell futures are nearly flat at -0.10%, implying leadership from large-cap and growth exposures rather than small caps. The average 1d index change of -0.19% combined with 8 up vs 7 down issues shows mixed but not stressed conditions, consistent with a market that is cautious rather than capitulating.

Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of a controlled risk environment. The VIX is essentially flat on the day (-0.12%) at 16.48, a relatively low level, though it is up 6.94% over 7d, reflecting some incremental hedging as equities softened. The 10Y Treasury yield eased 0.79% on the day to 4.15% after edging higher over 7d and 30d, signaling a small bid for safety but not a major flight to quality. Overall, risk appetite has cooled over the past week but is stabilizing with today's futures bounce and contained volatility.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral to slightly soft based on the benchmark changes.

A small drop in the 10Y yield to 4.15% alongside modest equity declines indicates cautious positioning ahead of data rather than a disorderly risk-off move.

1.2. **Leadership:** On a 1d basis, the Nasdaq Composite is a positive standout, rising 0.23%, with its proxy QQQ up 0.20%, while Dow-linked assets lag, with the Dow 30 down 0.62%. Over the last week, Dow benchmarks are comparatively resilient (Dow 30 +0.33%, Dow futures +1.34%) versus tech, as QQQ is down 2.20% and the Nasdaq Composite is off 1.98%. The Russell 2000 is mixed, down 0.45% on the day but roughly flat over 7d (-0.09%), highlighting that small caps are not leading in either direction. Overall, large-cap value/cyclicals tied to the Dow have led on the week, while growth/tech and the Nasdaq have been the primary laggards.

Additionally, ongoing news around U.S. trade deal uncertainty with India may impact EM sentiment and global risk appetite at the margin.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%: The modest 1d declines in major U.S. indices (S&P 500 -0.24%, Dow -0.62%, Russell 2000 -0.45%) are contrasted by a clear positive move in U.S. futures, with S&P futures up 0.70%, Nasdaq futures up 0.75%, and Dow futures up 0.63%, indicating buyers stepping in overnight. Volatility is contained with VIX flat and the 10Y yield slightly lower, suggesting no acute risk-off shock and room for a relief bounce into key data. While the past week has seen risk appetite fade (e.g., Nasdaq -1.98% 7d, VIX +6.94% 7d), the current setup points to a mildly constructive bias into the next session as markets anticipate clarity from upcoming macro releases.

3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch how index futures translate into cash market levels for the S&P 500 around 6,800, the Dow near 48,000, and the Nasdaq Composite just above 23,000. The overnight strength in S&P and Nasdaq futures versus flat-to-soft Russell futures underscores a continued large-cap and growth tilt; sustained leadership there would support the expected mild upward bias. Monitoring the VIX near 16.5 is key: a move lower would validate a risk-on tone, while a reversal higher would signal renewed hedging ahead of data. Macro-wise, attention should remain squarely on the U.S. jobs and inflation releases flagged in the news as central to the rate outlook, alongside any updates on central bank decision-making, particularly from the Bank of Japan. Traders should also track the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15% for confirmation: a stable or slightly lower yield would be consistent with a constructive equity open, while a sharp back-up in yields could cap upside. In cross-asset space, continued strength in gold and the U.S. dollar's short-term direction may provide additional clues on risk appetite and whether today's futures-led bounce can extend through the next session.
