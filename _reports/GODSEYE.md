  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across assets, the near-term tone is modestly risk-off but within a broader risk-on backdrop. Major U.S. equity indices slipped slightly on the day, with the S&P 500 down 0.03%, Dow 30 down 0.04%, Nasdaq Composite down 0.09%, and Russell 2000 underperforming at -0.54%, while average index change was -0.12%. At the same time, 7-day gains remain solid (S&P 500 +1.91%, Nasdaq +2.08%, SPY +1.99%, QQQ +2.12%), indicating that risk appetite has improved over the week despite today's softening.","Volatility and futures positioning point to contained risk premia and still-bullish positioning. The VIX ticked up 0.97% on the day but is down 17.5% over the week and 22.3% over the month to 13.6, consistent with a low-stress, risk-on regime. Equity futures were marginally lower to flat on the day (S&P -0.04%, Nasdaq -0.06%, Russell +0.02%, Dow +0.04%) but are up 2.3%–4.8% over the week, suggesting only a minor pause in an otherwise constructive trend.","Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive of risk. The 10Y Treasury yield was unchanged on the day at 4.14% and down 0.31% over the week, tempering financing headwinds even though it is 1.75% higher over 30 days. A weaker U.S. dollar (DXY -0.06% 1d, -0.42% 7d, -1.23% 30d) alongside strong gold (+4.0% 7d, +8.0% 30d) and rising crude over the week (+2.13%) reflect ongoing demand for real assets and cyclicals; overall, risk appetite is higher than a week ago but faded modestly in the last session."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive on a multi-day view but soft in the latest session. Breadth shows 4 instruments up versus 10 down and 1 flat, and the average 1-day index move is -0.12%, signaling a mild, broad-based cooling rather than a sharp risk-off. However, over the past week indices are up 0.6%–2.1% and the VIX is down 17.5%, which points to improving underlying sentiment. With the 10Y Treasury yield stable on the day and slightly lower over the week, the rates and volatility backdrop remains supportive even as near-term momentum pauses.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership was relatively defensive with Dow futures (YM=F) up 0.04% and Russell futures (RTY=F) edging higher by 0.02%, while most cash indices were fractionally negative. On the downside, the Russell 2000 cash index lagged with a -0.54% move, indicating small-cap underperformance versus large caps where the S&P 500 fell only 0.03%. Over the past week, Nasdaq futures are a clear leader with a 4.78% gain, while the Russell 2000 cash index is the weakest major U.S. equity benchmark at +0.60%, showing that mega-cap growth and tech-heavy exposures are outperforming smaller domestically focused names.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro sentiment is being buoyed by strong U.S. growth data and the seasonal "Santa Claus rally" narrative. News flow highlights that U.S. GDP expanded 4.3% in Q3, described as the fastest pace in years, and several articles note Wall Street indices near or at record highs in light post-holiday trade, framing year-end price action as a continuation of bullish sentiment. This backdrop supports a risk-on bias, consistent with 7-day equity gains of roughly 1.2%–2.1% and depressed VIX levels.","At the same time, global markets are seeing some year-end profit-taking and flows-driven volatility, which tempers the risk-on tone. Indian equity coverage points to three consecutive down sessions driven by foreign fund outflows and profit-taking, capping weekly gains, illustrating how extended markets can invite de-risking even in an overall bullish year. This behavior aligns with the latest mild pullback in U.S. indices and a small 0.97% uptick in VIX, indicating a short-term risk-off pause within a broader uptrend.","Precious metals strength and dollar softness are also shaping cross-asset risk appetite. Reports emphasize that gold and silver have been smashing records, with silver described as in a historic bull run and gold futures up 4.0% over 7 days and 8.0% over 30 days, while the U.S. dollar index has fallen 1.23% over the month. Robust gains in metals alongside a weaker dollar generally reflect investors hedging with real assets, which can coexist with equity strength but also flag underlying concerns about debt and currency stability, slightly diluting the otherwise clean risk-on story."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term event timing is not specified in the provided data, so specific releases or earnings for the next 24 hours are unknown. However, the news flow suggests markets are sensitive to updates on U.S. economic growth, year-end fund flows, and any further confirmation of the Santa Claus rally narrative, which could sway risk sentiment if new data or commentary emerge. Without explicit schedules in the dataset, the exact triggers and their expected effects over the next 24 hours are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up. Despite a small average index decline of -0.12% in the last session, major benchmarks have posted solid 7-day gains (S&P 500 +1.91%, Nasdaq +2.08%, Russell 2000 +0.60%), and equity futures are 2.3%–4.8% higher over the week, indicating an intact uptrend. The VIX remains low at 13.6 and is down sharply over 7 and 30 days, while the 10Y yield is stable to slightly lower over the week, and news flow emphasizes year-end bullish sentiment and indices near record highs; together these support a bias toward continuation of the risk-on move rather than a deeper pullback.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether U.S. equity indices can defend their recent weekly gains, particularly the S&P 500 around its current 6,900–7,000 zone and the Nasdaq Composite near 23,500–23,600, as a hold there would support the projected upward bias. Small caps deserve attention given the Russell 2000's -0.54% daily drop versus a 0.60% weekly rise; stabilization in Russell futures around 2,550 would signal improving breadth and reinforce risk-on sentiment, while further underperformance could challenge the uptrend narrative.","On the macro side, monitoring the VIX around the mid-teens and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.14% will be key for confirming benign financial conditions consistent with further equity gains. Cross-asset signals such as continued strength in Nasdaq futures (up 4.78% over the week) and resilience in gold and crude will help gauge appetite for growth and real assets; if futures remain firm and volatility contained overnight, it would validate the expectation of a modestly higher open and follow-through in the coming session."]

["Across assets, the near-term tone is modestly risk-off but within a broader risk-on backdrop.

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up.

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Across assets, the near-term tone is modestly risk-off but within a broader risk-on backdrop. Major U.S. equity indices slipped slightly on the day, with the S&amp;P 500 down 0.03%, Dow 30 down 0.04%, Nasdaq Composite down 0.09%, and Russell 2000 underperforming at -0.54%, while average index change was -0.12%. At the same time, 7-day gains remain solid (S&amp;P 500 +1.91%, Nasdaq +2.08%, SPY +1.99%, QQQ +2.12%), indicating that risk appetite has improved over the week despite today’s softening.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and futures positioning point to contained risk premia and still-bullish positioning.
