  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities show a mildly risk-off tone on the day but remain firmly risk-on over the week and month. The S&P 500 is down 0.09% on the day but up 1.67% over 7 days and 2.16% over 30 days, while the Nasdaq Composite is marginally higher today (+0.05%) and up 1.90% over 7 days. The Russell 2000 is the weakest on the day (-0.58%) but the strongest over the week (+5.12%), indicating recent risk appetite for small caps even as today's tape consolidates.","Volatility and futures confirm a cooling in near-term risk appetite against a still constructive backdrop. The VIX jumped 6.83% on the day to 15.48 and is up 3.55% over 7 days, though it remains almost 10% below its 30-day level, suggesting a pickup from very complacent conditions rather than outright stress. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all modestly lower on the day (around -0.11% to -0.55%) but higher 1.5–5.3% over 30 days, showing that the recent risk-on trend is pausing rather than reversing.","Rates and cross-asset moves point to a mildly more cautious tone despite strong recent equity performance. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.43% on the day and 4.78% over 30 days to 4.19%, which, alongside a 2.98% one-day jump and 11.01% 30-day surge in gold, signals some demand for safety or inflation/ policy hedges. With market breadth showing 10 benchmarks down versus 5 up and an average 1-day index change of -0.046%, today's data indicate risk appetite is fading at the margin after a stretch of solid gains, but not breaking down."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive over a multi-week horizon but softer in the very near term. Breadth is negative today, with 10 benchmarks down and 5 up, and the average 1-day index move is a small decline of about -0.046%, pointing to a mild consolidation rather than a sharp risk-off move. Volatility has risen, with the VIX up 6.83% on the day and 3.55% over the week, yet it remains nearly 10% below its 30-day level, suggesting conditions are still relatively calm. The 10Y Treasury yield grinding higher to 4.19% over the past month adds some pressure to valuations, but given indices' 7–30 day gains, the overall market still looks reasonably healthy, just less euphoric than a few sessions ago.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Dow 30 is a notable leader with a +0.48% move, while the Nasdaq Composite is slightly positive at +0.05%, showing relative resilience in large caps and growth. In contrast, small caps are lagging, with the Russell 2000 down 0.58% on the day and Russell futures off 0.49%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 and Russell futures stand out on the upside with gains of about 5.12% and 5.04%, respectively, while no major index shows a weekly loss, underscoring that today's underperformance in small caps comes after a strong run. On a 30-day basis, the Dow 30 (+5.08%) and Russell futures (+5.26%) are leading, whereas the Nasdaq Composite (+2.02%) and QQQ (+2.09%) are relative laggards, indicating recent leadership has tilted toward cyclicals and small caps rather than pure large-cap tech.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy optimism around US growth remains a key support for the tape even as near-term expectations for rate cuts have moderated. Recent headlines note that the S&P 500 rallied to a new record high on US economic optimism, and US GDP recently expanded at a 4.3% annualized pace, reflecting resilient consumer and business spending. This backdrop is broadly risk-on and helps explain why major indices are up 1.7–5.1% over the past week despite today's modest pullback.","At the same time, shifting Federal Reserve and rate expectations, along with strong labor data, are tempering the pace of the rally and contributing to higher yields and a firmer volatility profile. News that the dollar recently climbed as Fed rate cut expectations receded and that payrolls data "cements" the view the Fed will not cut quickly points to a more hawkish policy path. This aligns with the 10Y yield rising 4.78% over 30 days to 4.19% and a 6.83% jump in VIX today, a combination that leans modestly risk-off in the very short term even as equities remain near highs.","Sector and thematic stories, particularly around AI and energy, are also shaping risk-taking behavior. Articles highlighting an AI data center "bubble" narrative in energy-related names and commentary from Goldman Sachs about AI leaders potentially not earning enough profits to justify their capex point to pockets of froth and valuation concern in the AI complex. These narratives can introduce selective risk-off positioning in high-multiple growth and AI beneficiaries, which is consistent with today's slight underperformance in QQQ (-0.06%) and Nasdaq futures (-0.13%) despite their still solid 7–30 day gains."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key potential market movers over the next 24 hours center on US policy and trade developments, alongside any follow-through from recent macro data. The upcoming Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs is explicitly flagged as a major event with the potential to jolt markets, with coverage noting that a ruling against emergency tariff powers could impact fiscal plans and trade-sensitive sectors. Investors will also remain focused on Fed-related commentary and the implications of recent payroll and GDP data for the timing of rate cuts, as prior headlines indicate that receding cut expectations have supported the dollar and nudged yields higher. Any fresh news along these lines could influence risk sentiment by either validating the current consolidation or re-energizing the risk-on move.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Given that major equity indices are nearly flat to modestly down on the day (S&P 500 -0.09%, Nasdaq Composite +0.05%, SPY -0.09%) after solid 7-day gains of roughly 1.7–5.1%, price action is consistent with consolidation rather than a clear directional shift. The VIX's 6.83% jump and a small rise in the 10Y yield suggest a bit more caution, but volatility remains relatively low and the 30-day trend across indices is still upward. With a major policy catalyst in the form of the Supreme Court tariff ruling and ongoing Fed expectations in play, the most likely near-term outcome is rangebound, choppy trade rather than a decisive break higher or lower.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can hold recent gains despite today's small pullback, with futures currently off only about 0.11–0.13% on the day. Monitoring the behavior of small caps is important as well: the Russell 2000 has given back 0.58% today after a strong 5.12% weekly run, and further weakness there could signal fading risk appetite beyond mega caps. The VIX at 15.48, up 6.83% today but still down nearly 10% over 30 days, is another key gauge; a sustained move higher would argue that today's mild risk-off tone is becoming more entrenched.","On the macro and policy side, the Supreme Court's impending decision on Trump's tariff powers should be closely watched given explicit warnings it could "jolt markets," particularly in trade-sensitive and globally exposed sectors. Traders should also track any follow-up commentary around US growth and Fed policy after recent data that pushed out rate cut expectations, aligning with the 10Y yield's climb to 4.19%. In commodities and defensives, gold's sharp 2.98% one-day and 11.01% 30-day gains make it a barometer for hedging demand; whether that strength persists or reverses will help confirm if the current consolidation in equities remains benign and consistent with a flat bias."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equities show a mildly risk-off tone on the day but remain firmly risk-on over the week and month. The S&P 500 is down 0.09% on the day but up 1.67% over 7 days and 2.16% over 30 days, while the Nasdaq Composite is marginally higher today (+0.05%) and up 1.90% over 7 days. The Russell 2000 is the weakest on the day (-0.58%) but the strongest over the week (+5.12%), indicating recent risk appetite for small caps even as today's tape consolidates.","Volatility and futures confirm a cooling in near-term risk appetite against a still constructive backdrop. The VIX jumped 6.83% on the day to 15.48 and is up 3.55% over 7 days, though it remains almost 10% below its 30-day level, suggesting a pickup from very complacent conditions rather than outright stress. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are all modestly lower on the day (around -0.11% to -0.55%) but higher 1.5–5.3% over 30 days, showing that the recent risk-on trend is pausing rather than reversing.","Rates and cross-asset moves point to a mildly more cautious tone despite strong recent equity performance.

With market breadth showing 10 benchmarks down versus 5 up and an average 1-day index change of -0.046%, today's data indicate risk appetite is fading at the margin after a stretch of solid gains, but not breaking down."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive over a multi-week horizon but softer in the very near term. Breadth is negative today, with 10 benchmarks down and 5 up, and the average 1-day index move is a small decline of about -0.046%, pointing to a mild consolidation rather than a sharp risk-off move. Volatility has risen, with the VIX up 6.83% on the day and 3.55% over the week, yet it remains nearly 10% below its 30-day level, suggesting conditions are still relatively calm. The 10Y Treasury yield grinding higher to 4.19% over the past month adds some pressure to valuations, but given indices' 7–30 day gains, the overall market still looks reasonably healthy, just less euphoric than a few sessions ago.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Dow 30 is a notable leader with a +0.48% move, while the Nasdaq Composite is slightly positive at +0.05%, showing relative resilience in large caps and growth. In contrast, small caps are lagging, with the Russell 2000 down 0.58% on the day and Russell futures off 0.49%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 and Russell futures stand out on the upside with gains of about 5.12% and 5.04%, respectively, while no major index shows a weekly loss, underscoring that today's underperformance in small caps comes after a strong run. On a 30-day basis, the Dow 30 (+5.08%) and Russell futures (+5.26%) are leading, whereas the Nasdaq Composite (+2.02%) and QQQ (+2.09%) are relative laggards, indicating recent leadership has tilted toward cyclicals and small caps rather than pure large-cap tech.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy optimism around US growth remains a key support for the tape even as near-term expectations for rate cuts have moderated. Recent headlines note that the S&P 500 rallied to a new record high on US economic optimism, and US GDP recently expanded at a 4.3% annualized pace, reflecting resilient consumer and business spending. This backdrop is broadly risk-on and helps explain why major indices are up 1.7–5.1% over the past week despite today's modest pullback.","At the same time, shifting Federal Reserve and rate expectations, along with strong labor data, are tempering the pace of the rally and contributing to higher yields and a firmer volatility profile. News that the dollar recently climbed as Fed rate cut expectations receded and that payrolls data "cements" the view the Fed will not cut quickly points to a more hawkish policy path. This aligns with the 10Y yield rising 4.78% over 30 days to 4.19% and a 6.83% jump in VIX today, a combination that leans modestly risk-off in the very short term even as equities remain near highs.","Sector and thematic stories, particularly around AI and energy, are also shaping risk-taking behavior. Articles highlighting an AI data center "bubble" narrative in energy-related names and commentary from Goldman Sachs about AI leaders potentially not earning enough profits to justify their capex point to pockets of froth and valuation concern in the AI complex. These narratives can introduce selective risk-off positioning in high-multiple growth and AI beneficiaries, which is consistent with today's slight underperformance in QQQ (-0.06%) and Nasdaq futures (-0.13%) despite their still solid 7–30 day gains."]

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key potential market movers over the next 24 hours center on US policy and trade developments, alongside any follow-through from recent macro data. The upcoming Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs is explicitly flagged as a major event with the potential to jolt markets, with coverage noting that a ruling against emergency tariff powers could impact fiscal plans and trade-sensitive sectors. Investors will also remain focused on Fed-related commentary and the implications of recent payroll and GDP data for the timing of rate cuts, as prior headlines indicate that receding cut expectations have supported the dollar and nudged yields higher. Any fresh news along these lines could influence risk sentiment by either validating the current consolidation or re-energizing the risk-on move.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Given that major equity indices are nearly flat to modestly down on the day (S&P 500 -0.09%, Nasdaq Composite +0.05%, SPY -0.09%) after solid 7-day gains of roughly 1.7–5.1%, price action is consistent with consolidation rather than a clear directional shift. The VIX's 6.83% jump and a small rise in the 10Y yield suggest a bit more caution, but volatility remains relatively low and the 30-day trend across indices is still upward. With a major policy catalyst in the form of the Supreme Court tariff ruling and ongoing Fed expectations in play, the most likely near-term outcome is rangebound, choppy trade rather than a decisive break higher or lower.

Traders should also track any follow-up commentary around US growth and Fed policy after recent data that pushed out rate cut expectations, aligning with the 10Y yield's climb to 4.19%. In commodities and defensives, gold's sharp 2.98% one-day and 11.01% 30-day gains make it a barometer for hedging demand; whether that strength persists or reverses will help confirm if the current consolidation in equities remains benign and consistent with a flat bias."]

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Equities show a mildly risk-off tone on the day but remain firmly risk-on over the week and month. The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.09% on the day but up 1.67% over 7 days and 2.16% over 30 days, while the Nasdaq Composite is marginally higher today (+0.05%) and up 1.90% over 7 days. The Russell 2000 is the weakest on the day (-0.58%) but the strongest over the week (+5.12%), indicating recent risk appetite for small caps even as today’s tape consolidates.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and futures confirm a cooling in near-term risk appetite against a still constructive backdrop. The VIX jumped 6.83% on the day
