  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is tentatively improving on the day: tech and small caps are green (Nasdaq Composite +0.69%, QQQ +0.61%, Russell 2000 +0.59%), SPY is up +0.40%, and equity futures are firmer (ES +0.43%, NQ +0.64%, RTY +0.72%). Volatility eased (VIX -1.00% to 19.80), and market breadth shows more advances than declines (10 up, 5 down).
  
  That said, the tape remains fragile versus the past week: the Nasdaq and small caps are still lower over 7 days (-2.00% and -2.75%, respectively) while VIX is higher (+9.94% w/w, +18.92% m/m). Rates are a mild headwind today with the 10Y yield up 0.73% to 4.14%, and the average 1-day change across indices is slightly negative (-0.17%), reflecting lingering crosscurrents.
  
  Commodities and FX add nuance: WTI crude rose +2.61% (60.22), which can buoy Energy but stoke inflation concerns, while gold fell -1.84% and the US dollar edged higher (+0.18%). On balance, today’s tone is modest risk-on, but the elevated VIX and weak 7-day performance in growth/small caps temper conviction.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mixed. Breadth is positive (10 up, 5 down), yet the average 1-day index change is slightly negative at -0.17%, indicating gains are not broad-based enough to overwhelm pockets of weakness. Volatility sits elevated despite today’s dip (VIX 19.8, -1.0% d/d but +9.9% w/w), and the 10Y yield ticked up to 4.14% (+0.73% d/d), which can constrain multiples. Overall, conditions look tentatively constructive day-on-day but still fragile versus the weekly backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to growth on the day with the Nasdaq Composite up +0.69% and QQQ +0.61%, while the Russell 2000 also outperformed at +0.59%. Laggards included the Dow 30, down -1.65% on the day, and the S&P 500 cash index at -1.66%. Over the week, the Dow 30 leads at +0.79%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-2.00%) and Russell 2000 (-2.75%) are notable underperformers.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Headlines around the US government reopening have coincided with pressure on growth stocks earlier in the week, as highlighted by coverage noting a sharp drop in the Nasdaq 100. That aligns with the 7-day declines in the Nasdaq Composite (-2.00%) and Russell 2000 (-2.75%), reinforcing a recent risk-off tilt that lifted VIX over the week (+9.94%). Consumer sentiment fragility tied to a ‘K‑shaped’ economy theme points to uneven demand and sensitivity among lower-income cohorts. This macro tone is consistent with elevated volatility (VIX 19.8, +18.92% over 30 days) and could cap cyclicals’ momentum, skewing the broader risk stance toward caution even as select benchmarks rebound day-on-day. Energy market developments are supportive near term, with oil up +2.61% and recent reports citing strong fuel premiums and supply concerns. Higher crude can aid Energy-led risk-on rotation but may nudge inflation expectations and rates (10Y +0.73% d/d), adding a counterweight for duration-sensitive equity segments.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% Most benchmarks and futures are firmer (SPY +0.40%, QQQ +0.61%, ES +0.43%, NQ +0.64%, RTY +0.72%) with VIX easing (-1.00% to 19.8) and breadth positive (10 up, 5 down), suggesting a modest risk-on bias for the next session, albeit tempered by elevated weekly volatility and a small rise in the 10Y yield (+0.73%).
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether ES holds gains around 6,789 and NQ near 25,255, and whether VIX stays below 20; sustained sub‑20 volatility would support a constructive open. In equities, monitor QQQ at 612 and SPY around 675 for follow‑through; continued Nasdaq leadership would confirm the day’s growth tilt. Keep an eye on the 10Y yield near 4.14% and WTI at 60.22; a further rise in yields or crude could pressure multiples while aiding Energy. Small caps (RTY ~2,407) bounced today—follow‑through would help broaden participation after a weak week (-2.68% on Russell futures over 7 days). Headline risk tied to the US government reopening narrative has been affecting sentiment; any additional updates could sway the risk tone. Also watch the US dollar at 99.36 and gold at 4,110 for confirmation of risk-on (firmer USD/softer gold) versus a reversal that could flag renewed risk aversion.
