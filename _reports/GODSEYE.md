  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Cross-asset tone is modestly risk-on, with 11 of 15 tracked instruments higher on the day and an average index gain of about 0.22%. The S&P 500 is up 0.20% and Dow 30 up 0.52%, while small caps outperform sharply with the Russell 2000 up 1.16% on the day and 3.85% over the week, signaling improving risk appetite toward cyclicals and domestically oriented names.",
      "Volatility is easing, with the VIX down 6.2% on the day to 15.71 and lower by 5.3% over 30 days, consistent with a calmer, risk-on backdrop despite a 6.5% rise over the past week. Equity futures confirm the constructive tone, with S&P futures up 0.27%, Dow futures up 0.59%, Nasdaq futures up 0.44%, and Russell futures up 1.07% on the day, indicating buyers remain in control near term.",
      "Rates and FX are broadly stable-to-firm rather than stressed: the 10-year Treasury yield is up just 0.48% on the day to 4.16%, while the US Dollar index is up 0.20% on the day and 0.76% over the week. The combination of modestly higher yields, a slightly firmer dollar, and a sharply lower VIX alongside broad equity gains points to improving, not fading, risk appetite, though sector leadership is rotating away from growth-heavy Nasdaq, which is down 1.0% on the day."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health screens as moderately strong. Breadth is positive with 11 assets up versus 4 down, and the average 1-day index move of roughly +0.22% reflects a steady advance rather than a blow-off move. The VIX falling 6.2% today to 15.71 shows declining hedging demand and a benign volatility backdrop. A small 0.48% uptick in the 10-year yield to 4.16%, combined with generally higher equities, suggests the market is absorbing rate moves comfortably for now.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear equity leader with a +1.16% gain, and its futures counterpart is up 1.07%, while the Dow 30 also stands out on the upside with a +0.52% move. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is the notable laggard, falling 1.00% on the day, and tech-proxy QQQ is only slightly positive at +0.29%, underscoring relative weakness in growth/tech versus small caps and cyclicals.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "Macro data and inflation trends are supporting a risk-on tone in higher-beta assets. One headline notes that supportive US inflation data has boosted confidence in risk assets alongside a surge in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, implying that softer inflation is being interpreted as less pressure on central banks and more room for speculative and growth exposures.",
      "Policy and political uncertainty remain a background theme, but current equity behavior suggests they are not dominating tape action today. Research commentary highlights Wall Street's focus on shifting leadership away from the prior "Magnificent 7" concentration, which fits with the observed outperformance of the Russell 2000 and Dow versus the Nasdaq; this rotation is risk-on in breadth terms but risk-off specifically for expensive mega-cap tech.",
      "Geopolitical and macro policy debates, including central bank balance sheet discussions and widening global imbalances flagged by institutions like the IMF and Fed, form part of the narrative but are not directly tied to sharp moves in the provided benchmarks. With US 10-year yields roughly flat over the week (-0.45%) and volatility subdued on a 30-day view, these themes appear to be exerting a muted, more structural than immediate, impact on risk appetite."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key near-term catalysts referenced include upcoming U.S. retail sales and Producer Price Index (PPI) data, with futures commentary noting investors are trimming risk ahead of these prints, which can move expectations for growth and inflation. In addition, more large U.S. bank earnings are on tap, which can swing financials and broader indices depending on guidance and trading results. Crypto-specific events like a BitMine shareholder vote and ongoing crypto market strength are also in focus, which may influence risk sentiment at the margin but are more directly impactful for digital asset markets than for major equity benchmarks.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The bias over the next 24 hours skews slightly higher, as broad equities are positive (S&P 500 +0.20%, Dow +0.52%, Russell 2000 +1.16%) with strong breadth (11 up vs 4 down), equity futures are green across the board, and the VIX is down 6.2% to 15.71, indicating easing fear. While the Nasdaq Composite is a notable laggard at -1.0%, rotation into small caps and cyclicals plus stable-to-mildly higher rates and supportive inflation headlines point to a constructive, if modest, upside path into the next session, barring a negative surprise from upcoming U.S. retail sales or PPI data.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and its futures can build on today's roughly 0.2–0.3% gains and hold recent highs, with S&P futures already up 2.12% over 30 days and cash S&P up 1.62%. Continued leadership from the Russell 2000, which is up 8.82% over 30 days and 3.85% over the week, would confirm the rotation into smaller, more cyclical names that is consistent with an "up" bias; fading of that outperformance would be an early warning that the rally is narrowing.",
      "On the macro side, the key overnight and next-session focus will be U.S. retail sales and PPI data, as prior commentary shows futures softening when investors trim risk ahead of those releases, and both prints can quickly shift views on inflation and growth. Traders should also track the 10-year Treasury yield near 4.16% and the VIX around 15–16: a stable or slightly lower yield and a VIX that stays depressed would align with the expected modest upside, while a jump in either around the data could flip the tone back toward risk-off despite today's positive breadth.",
      "Sector-wise, the divergence between the lagging Nasdaq Composite (-1.0% on the day) and resilient QQQ (+0.29%) versus strength in the Dow and Russell argues for close monitoring of mega-cap tech versus financials and cyclicals as bank earnings hit. If bank results and guidance are well received, the Dow and Russell could extend gains and support the overall market even if tech underperforms; conversely, disappointment in financials could undercut this leadership and challenge the "up" bias despite the currently supportive volatility and breadth backdrop."

Equity futures confirm the constructive tone, with S&P futures up 0.27%, Dow futures up 0.59%, Nasdaq futures up 0.44%, and Russell futures up 1.07% on the day, indicating buyers remain in control near term.",
    "Rates and FX are broadly stable-to-firm rather than stressed: the 10-year Treasury yield is up just 0.48% on the day to 4.16%, while the US Dollar index is up 0.20% on the day and 0.76% over the week.
