  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities show a mildly risk-on tone today, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90%, and the Dow 30 up 0.47%, while the Russell 2000 is flat to slightly negative at -0.05%. Over the past week, however, all four U.S. benchmarks are still down between roughly 0.47% (^GSPC) and 1.12% (^DJI), and the Nasdaq is off 0.94%, indicating that today's bounce is a partial retracement within a short-term consolidation rather than a clean trend reversal. ETFs mirror this pattern, with SPY up 0.72% and QQQ up 0.88% on the day but both negative over 7 days.","Volatility and futures support a modest improvement in risk appetite on a very short horizon, but within a higher-risk backdrop. The VIX is down 5.64% on the day to 19.09, signaling easing near-term stress, yet it remains elevated versus 30 days ago, up 24.12%, underscoring that overall risk premia are still higher than a month back. S&P and Nasdaq futures gained 0.67% and 0.84% respectively today, while Dow futures added 0.44% and Russell futures were flat (-0.01%), pointing to stronger demand for large-cap growth than for small caps even as the 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day (+0.27%) and lower over the week and month, which modestly supports equities but also aligns with lingering caution.","Rates and cross-asset signals paint a mixed but not distressed tone, with risk appetite improving intraday yet still constrained by defensive flows. The 10Y yield at 4.09 is down about 1.47% over the week and 1.26% over the month, which, combined with a 13.71% 30-day surge in gold and an 18.57% rise in WTI crude, reflects persistent macro and geopolitical risk hedging even as equities try to recover. Overall, risk appetite is improving on the day but is still fading on a 1-week horizon, with average index gains of about 0.60% today set against negative 7-day returns and a structurally higher VIX."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks guardedly constructive in the very near term but not robust. Breadth is positive, with 10 instruments up versus 5 down and none flat, and the average 1d index move of roughly +0.60% shows a reasonably broad bounce. However, on a 7-day basis, all major U.S. indices remain negative and the VIX is still up 7.31% over the week and 24.12% over 30 days, which tempers the strength of today's advance. The 10Y Treasury yield drifting lower over the week and month suggests some defensive bid in rates that is consistent with a market that is stabilizing rather than fully healthy.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is clearly in large-cap U.S. growth and tech: the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.90% and QQQ rose 0.88%, outpacing the S&P 500's 0.69% and SPY's 0.72%. On the downside, small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.05% and Russell futures essentially flat at -0.01%, making them notable underperformers on the day. On a 1-week view, the Dow 30 is the weakest of the major U.S. benchmarks at -1.12%, while the Russell 2000 is also soft at -0.60%, whereas no major U.S. index shows a positive 7d return, underscoring that recent leadership has been defensive and that today's tech-led pop is still working against a weak weekly tape.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical tensions remain a key overhang on risk sentiment, even as U.S. indices bounce today. Recent reports highlight U.S.-Iran tensions weighing on global stocks and propping up oil and gold, with one article noting global stocks slipping as investors focused on earnings while U.S.-Iran tensions kept markets on edge. This backdrop is consistent with WTI crude up 18.57% and gold up 13.71% over 30 days, a classic risk-off hedge pattern that, despite today's equity strength, signals that geopolitical risk continues to cap risk appetite.","Concerns around AI-driven disruption and high-tech valuations are another prominent macro-market theme. Coverage of recent Wall Street action points to stocks being pressured by AI concerns and geopolitical risks, with declines in Nvidia, Apple, and private equity firms cited as key drivers of a prior selloff. This aligns with the Nasdaq's weaker 30-day performance (-2.96%) and QQQ's -2.44% over 30 days, suggesting that while tech is leading today's rebound (+0.90% on the Nasdaq Composite and +0.84% on Nasdaq futures), the underlying narrative of valuation and disruption risk has kept volatility elevated (VIX +24.12% over 30 days) and encouraged more tactical, rather than structural, risk-taking.","Regionally, mixed corporate results and local macro pressures are reinforcing a global risk-on/risk-off tug-of-war. The NZ sharemarket's 1% drop on disappointing company results, Indian equities' recent selling tied to stronger dollar moves, rising crude, and geopolitical tension, and commentary about AI-related pressure on IT stocks all point to a scattered, headline-sensitive global environment. For U.S. assets, this reinforces an environment where bouts of risk-on buying, like today's 0.69–0.90% gains in major indices, coexist with sustained hedging via safe havens and lingering caution reflected in the VIX's higher 7d and 30d levels."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The provided data does not specify any concrete earnings releases, macroeconomic data, or policy decisions scheduled over the next 24 hours that could move the market, so upcoming triggers are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% While U.S. indices are higher today (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq Composite +0.90%, Dow 30 +0.47%) and volatility is lower on the session (VIX -5.64% to 19.09), the 7-day trend across equities remains negative and the VIX is still up 7.31% over the week and 24.12% over the month. Futures moves are constructive but moderate (S&P futures +0.67%, Nasdaq futures +0.84%, Dow futures +0.44%), and small caps are flat to slightly negative, pointing to selective rather than broad-based risk-on. Coupled with persistent geopolitical and AI-related concerns highlighted in the news and strong defensive positioning in gold (+13.71% over 30 days), this mix suggests a balanced risk-reward over the next 24 hours with no clear directional edge, hence a flat bias with moderate confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether today's tech-led bounce can sustain, focusing on the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ relative to the S&P 500 and SPY, given their stronger 1d gains (around +0.9%) but weaker 30d performance (Nasdaq -2.96%, QQQ -2.44%). Persistent underperformance in the Russell 2000 (1d -0.05%, 7d -0.60%) versus its strong 30d gain (+3.43%) is another key tell; further fading in small caps would signal a defensive re-rotation, while renewed strength would argue for healthier breadth and support for an upside break. Monitoring the VIX around the 19 handle is also important, as failure to push meaningfully lower despite equity strength would confirm that risk appetite remains constrained.","On the macro side, keep an eye on gold and crude oil, which have both surged over the past month (gold +13.71%, WTI +18.57%), as any acceleration higher would likely reflect escalating geopolitical tension and could pressure risk assets again. The 10Y Treasury yield around 4.09, modestly lower over 7 and 30 days, should be tracked for signs of a renewed flight to safety; a rapid drop in yields alongside rising VIX would challenge the flat bias and lean the tape risk-off. Cross-referencing these macro signals with headline flow on U.S.-Iran developments and AI/tech sentiment in upcoming sessions will help gauge whether today's equity rebound can evolve into a more durable move or remains a short-covering bounce."]

["Equities show a mildly risk-on tone today, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90%, and the Dow 30 up 0.47%, while the Russell 2000 is flat to slightly negative at -0.05%.
