  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite improved on the day as equities rebounded broadly: S&P 500 +0.98%, Dow +1.08%, Nasdaq +0.88%, and small caps surged with the Russell 2000 +2.80%. Equity futures echoed the tone (ES +0.96%, YM +1.08%, NQ +0.72%, RTY +2.80%), while the VIX fell 11.32% to 23.43 and the 10Y yield eased 1.05% to 4.06%, a supportive rates backdrop for stocks.
  
  Despite the bounce, the weekly picture shows fading risk appetite with all major indices lower over 7 days (Nasdaq -4.84%, Dow -4.16%, S&P -3.62%, Russell -3.31%) and the VIX still up 33.81% week-over-week. The US Dollar is firmer over 7 and 30 days, and WTI slid 1.83% on the day, underscoring a cautious macro tone beneath Friday’s relief rally.
  
  Overall, the near-term tone is a risk-on respite within a risk-off week, quantified by strong breadth (12 up vs 3 down) and an average 1-day index gain of 1.25%, offset by elevated volatility versus a week ago and negative 7-day returns across benchmarks.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks improved on the day but still fragile in context. Breadth was strong (12 up, 3 down) with an average index gain of 1.25%, and volatility eased as VIX fell 11.32% alongside a 1.05% dip in the 10Y yield to 4.06%. However, major indices are still down on the week and VIX remains 33.81% higher versus 7 days ago. The mix points to a constructive bounce within a broader risk-off week.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership favored small caps and cyclicals with the Russell 2000 up 2.80% on the day, while mega-cap growth lagged with QQQ up 0.75% and Nasdaq futures up 0.72%. Over the week, the Nasdaq Composite is the notable laggard at -4.84%, whereas the Dow’s -4.16% and S&P’s -3.62% declines also reflect broad weakness.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fed commentary buoyed risk sentiment into Friday, as noted by reports that a Federal Reserve official’s remarks boosted confidence in the likelihood of a rate cut, aligning with the 10Y yield slipping 1.05% and VIX falling 11.32% on the day; this supported a risk-on bounce in equities. Conversely, the broader tape has been pressured by concerns around an AI-driven bubble and tech leadership fatigue, with coverage highlighting a turbulent week and AI-related selling; that aligns with the Nasdaq’s -4.84% 7-day decline and the VIX’s 33.81% weekly spike, a risk-off impulse that tempered Friday’s rebound. Additional macro cross-currents include a firmer US Dollar over the past week and reports of currency and FPI strain in emerging markets, which typically tighten global financial conditions; this backdrop helped keep weekly equity performance negative despite the day’s improvement.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% The strong 1-day rebound (avg index +1.25%, Russell +2.80%) and softer rates (10Y -1.05%) argue for stability, but elevated weekly volatility (VIX +33.81% 7d) and negative 7-day returns across indices suggest lingering fragility with no clear near-term catalyst in the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P futures around 6,620 and Nasdaq futures near 24,305 for confirmation that Friday’s rebound can hold, and monitor the VIX at 23.4 for a sustained drift lower; a move back toward its prior 26.4 reference would challenge the flat bias. Track small-cap leadership via Russell futures around 2,375 to see if breadth persists, and keep an eye on the 10Y yield around 4.06% for evidence that supportive rates endure; a rise in yields or renewed USD strength could cap upside. On commodities, WTI near 58 and Gold around 4,079 serve as risk proxies; further oil softness alongside elevated volatility would be a caution signal, while steadier gold and a contained VIX would favor a neutral-to-stable tape into the next session.
