  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is clearly risk-on, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day and week. The S&P 500 is up 0.54% on the day and 3.50% over 7 days, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.65% and 4.16%, and the Dow 30 is up 0.61% and 3.52%, respectively. Small caps are outperforming over the week, with the Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day and 6.46% on the week, signaling broadening risk appetite.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm improving sentiment. The VIX is down 4.89% on the day and nearly 34% over the week to 16.35, indicating a sharp retreat in hedging demand and calmer expectations for near-term swings. Equity futures are extending gains beyond the cash close, with S&P futures up 1.25%, Nasdaq futures up 1.07%, Dow futures up 2.06%, and Russell futures up 2.44% on the day, pointing to follow-through buying. This combination of rising prices, strong futures, and collapsing volatility shows risk appetite is improving materially.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive rather than restrictive. The 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day (+0.48%) and is down 2.57% over the week to about 4.02%, a backdrop that eases pressure on equity valuations. At the same time, gold futures are up 4.13% on the day and 4.24% over the week, and WTI crude is modestly higher on the day, showing that while risk appetite has improved, there is still demand for hard assets. The US dollar index is marginally softer over 1d and 7d, which tends to align with a more constructive global risk tone.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark moves. Breadth is robust, with 13 instruments up versus only 2 down and an average index change of about +0.62% on the day, indicating gains are not narrowly concentrated. The VIX sliding nearly 5% on the day and about 34% on the week to 16.35 points to a healthier volatility backdrop versus recent weeks. With the 10Y yield sitting near 4.02% and lower over the past week, the rates environment is not currently undermining the rally, supporting the view of a relatively healthy tape.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day and week is coming from growth and small caps, with QQQ up 0.81% on the day and 3.85% on the week, and the Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day and 6.46% on the week. Among futures, Russell futures are a standout with a 2.44% daily gain, followed by Dow futures up 2.06%. On the laggard side, Russell futures are still down 1.31% over 30 days despite the recent rebound, and WTI crude is negative over the week at -0.78% even after a 1.33% daily gain, showing energy has been a relative drag.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and geopolitical news flow is relatively light and fragmented, so the tape appears to be driven more by positioning, seasonality, and evolving rate-cut expectations than by a single dominant headline. Articles referencing weaker job growth and lower inflation fueling expectations for a Fed cut in December, along with commentary on investors focusing on the Federal Reserve meeting, align with the observed decline in the 10Y yield over the last week (-2.57%) and the sharp drop in the VIX (-33.78%). This backdrop is supportive of a risk-on tone, as easier policy expectations and calmer rates typically encourage flows into equities and cyclicals. Global trading conditions have been shaped by holiday-thinned volumes and some technical disruptions, which can amplify moves. Reports of a CME Group outage halting futures and Treasuries trading, and separate coverage of world shares trading mixed in thin holiday sessions as tech momentum briefly cooled, underscore that recent price action is occurring in less liquid markets. Nonetheless, US benchmarks have pushed higher and tech has rebounded, consistent with news that stock markets rallied on Fed rate-cut hopes and AI enthusiasm, which is a net risk-on catalyst despite episodic volatility. At the micro and thematic level, news flow about AI-related investment, corporate earnings focus, and sector-specific developments (such as airline route expansions and hospitality strategies) points to an environment where investors are leaning into structural growth stories rather than reacting to acute macro stress. For example, coverage highlighting that AI adoption is still early but driving significant capex aligns with the outperformance of growth proxies like the Nasdaq Composite (+4.16% over 7 days) and QQQ (+3.85% over 7 days. This thematic support for tech and growth contributes to the improving risk appetite seen in equity and futures markets.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete, time-stamped events over the next 24 hours are not specified in the provided data, so upcoming triggers are unknown. However, the search results reference investors watching delayed inflation data, consumer updates, and Fed-related developments during this holiday period, suggesting that any scheduled US inflation prints or labor data, if released in the next day, could significantly impact markets by shifting rate-cut expectations. In addition, any further updates on the CME Group's systems after the recent trading outage could affect futures liquidity and short-term volatility if new issues emerge. Specific earnings or policy meetings for the next 24 hours are not detailed, so their impact is unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence. Major US equity indices are all trending higher on the day and week, with the S&P 500 up 0.54%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.65%, and Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day, while futures are adding another 1–2% across S&P, Dow, Nasdaq, and Russell, signaling strong positive momentum into the next session. Volatility is compressing sharply, with the VIX down nearly 5% on the day and about 34% on the week, and the 10Y yield has eased over the last week, creating a supportive macro backdrop. News flow emphasizes Fed rate-cut hopes and ongoing AI- and growth-led optimism, which aligns with the observed leadership in tech and small caps, supporting a bias toward further upside in the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Overnight and into the next session, traders should closely watch equity futures to see if the current 1–2% gains in S&P (6,805.50), Nasdaq (25,215.25), Dow (47,473.00), and Russell (2,477.80) futures hold or extend, as this will confirm the projected upside bias. Any reversal in the VIX from its current 16.35 level, especially a move back above the high teens, would be an early warning that the risk-on tone is fading. Monitoring the 10Y Treasury yield around the 4.0% area is also important; a renewed spike higher would challenge the current equity-friendly rates setup. From a sector and style standpoint, traders should watch whether leadership remains with tech and growth, as reflected in QQQ (up 0.81% on the day and 3.85% on the week) and the Nasdaq Composite (up 4.16% over 7 days), and whether small caps keep outperforming via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures (+6.46% and +3.41% over the week, respectively). Sustained outperformance in these areas would reinforce the risk-on narrative and support further index gains. Additionally, cross-asset behavior in gold, which is up 4.13% on the day, and the US dollar, slightly weaker over the week, should be monitored for signs of either an extension of pro-risk positioning or a shift back toward defensive hedges. Given the prior CME Group futures and Treasuries outage, traders should remain attentive to any operational or liquidity headlines that could abruptly affect overnight price discovery. If futures volumes and price action remain orderly and aligned with the current gains, it will bolster confidence in the rally's durability into the next session. Conversely, any renewed disruptions or sharp, uncorrelated swings in futures pricing versus cash indices would merit short-term caution despite the broadly bullish setup.
