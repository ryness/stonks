  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities closed mixed, signaling tentative risk appetite: the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65% while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 added 0.22%. On a 7-day view, risk appetite has faded with the S&P 500 down 0.91%, the Nasdaq off 2.55%, and the Russell 2000 down 3.11%, indicating broader de-risking despite today’s modest stabilization.
  
  Volatility eased slightly on the day with VIX down 0.85% to 19.83, but it remains elevated versus recent history, up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over the month, consistent with a more cautious backdrop. Futures were similarly mixed-to-soft: S&P -0.07%, Nasdaq flat (-0.00%), Dow -0.67%, and Russell +0.25%, while the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, a headwind to risk.
  
  Cross-asset moves were two-sided: gold fell 2.37% and WTI crude rose 2.39%, while the US dollar edged up 0.09% on the day and is down 0.93% over the week. Taken together, the daily tape shows modest risk-on pockets in tech and small caps, but the weekly drawdowns in indices and higher VIX point to cooling risk appetite overall.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mildly negative: breadth was 7 up vs 8 down and the average index change was -0.05%, indicating slight net selling. The VIX at 19.83 dipped 0.85% on the day but remains higher on a 7-day basis (+10.11%), reflecting a still-elevated volatility regime. The 10Y Treasury yield rose to 4.15% (+0.88% 1d), adding pressure to equities via tighter financial conditions. Overall, stability intraday contrasts with a weaker weekly trend and a volatility backdrop that remains firm.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership was mixed on the day: the Russell 2000 (+0.22%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.13%) outperformed, while the Dow 30 lagged (-0.65%). Over the past week, small caps and tech have been the notable laggards (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq Composite -2.55%), whereas the Dow (-0.35%) held up relatively better than peers and the S&P 500 fell 0.91%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** The Guardian highlights that global markets struggled after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy, aligning with the past week’s weakness in growth benchmarks (Nasdaq Fut -2.53% 7d) and small caps (Russell Fut -3.13% 7d). This narrative skews risk-off, consistent with elevated VIX on a weekly basis (+10.11%) and broad index declines over the week. Geopolitical tension remains in focus with reporting on US military planning for a divided Gaza ‘green zone,’ which coincides with a 2.39% rise in WTI crude on the day. Such headlines can underpin energy prices and keep risk premia elevated, a setup that tends to be risk-off for broader equities if it persists. Trade policy headlines were incrementally positive as Australia welcomed the removal of US tariffs on beef and other food imports, a risk-on signal for trade-exposed and agriculture-linked segments. While the immediate impact on major US indices appears modest, it marginally reduces trade friction and provides a small offset to broader macro uncertainty.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The 1-day tape was mixed (S&P -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%) with futures little changed (ES -0.07%, NQ -0.00%), while VIX eased 0.85% but remains elevated on the week and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15%. Catalysts skew cautious (tech sell-off, China worries) yet there’s no fresh data trigger provided, suggesting range-bound trade over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch volatility and rates first: VIX around 19.83 is pivotal—sustained moves back above 20 would likely pressure risk assets, while a drift lower would ease conditions. The 10Y Treasury at 4.15% bears monitoring; further yield strength would likely weigh on cyclicals and the Dow, which already lagged (-0.65% 1d). Track index and futures levels for confirmation: ES at 6,755 and NQ at 25,094 need to hold steady to keep a flat-to-firm bias, while YM at 47,229 has been the weakest tape. Small caps are a tell—RTY futures at 2,396 and the Russell 2000 at 2,388; a sustained push above 2,400 would signal better breadth, while rejection there would confirm ongoing risk aversion. Monitor headline risk tied to the China growth narrative and Middle East developments cited in the news flow, as both have recently coincided with tech underperformance and firmer crude. Sector-wise, watch whether QQQ (608.86) can stabilize relative to SPY (671.93) and whether energy strength persists alongside WTI at 60.09.

## 1. Pulse

Equities closed mixed, signaling tentative risk appetite: the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65% while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 added 0.22%. On a 7-day view, risk appetite has faded with the S&P 500 down 0.91%, the Nasdaq off 2.55%, and the Russell 2000 down 3.11%, indicating broader de-risking despite today’s modest stabilization.

Volatility eased slightly on the day with VIX down 0.85% to 19.83, but it remains elevated versus recent history, up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over the month, consistent with a more cautious backdrop. Futures were similarly mixed-to-soft: S&P -0.07%, Nasdaq flat (-0.00%), Dow -0.67%, and Russell +0.25%, while the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, a headwind to risk.

Cross-asset moves were two-sided: gold fell 2.37% and WTI crude rose 2.39%, while the US dollar edged up 0.09% on the day and is down 0.93% over the week. Taken together, the daily tape shows modest risk-on pockets in tech and small caps, but the weekly drawdowns in indices and higher VIX point to cooling risk appetite overall.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mildly negative: breadth was 7 up vs 8 down and the average index change was -0.05%, indicating slight net selling. The VIX at 19.83 dipped 0.85% on the day but remains higher on a 7-day basis (+10.11%), reflecting a still-elevated volatility regime. The 10Y Treasury yield rose to 4.15% (+0.88% 1d), adding pressure to equities via tighter financial conditions. Overall, stability intraday contrasts with a weaker weekly trend and a volatility backdrop that remains firm.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership was mixed on the day: the Russell 2000 (+0.22%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.13%) outperformed, while the Dow 30 lagged (-0.65%). Over the past week, small caps and tech have been the notable laggards (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq Composite -2.55%), whereas the Dow (-0.35%) held up relatively better than peers and the S&P 500 fell 0.91%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** The Guardian highlights that global markets struggled after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy, aligning with the past week’s weakness in growth benchmarks (Nasdaq Fut -2.53% 7d) and small caps (Russell Fut -3.13% 7d). This narrative skews risk-off, consistent with elevated VIX on a weekly basis (+10.11%) and broad index declines over the week. Geopolitical tension remains in focus with reporting on US military planning for a divided Gaza ‘green zone,’ which coincides with a 2.39% rise in WTI crude on the day. Such headlines can underpin energy prices and keep risk premia elevated, a setup that tends to be risk-off for broader equities if it persists. Trade policy headlines were incrementally positive as Australia welcomed the removal of US tariffs on beef and other food imports, a risk-on signal for trade-exposed and agriculture-linked segments. While the immediate impact on major US indices appears modest, it marginally reduces trade friction and provides a small offset to broader macro uncertainty.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The 1-day tape was mixed (S&P -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%) with futures little changed (ES -0.07%, NQ -0.00%), while VIX eased 0.85% but remains elevated on the week and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15%. Catalysts skew cautious (tech sell-off, China worries) yet there’s no fresh data trigger provided, suggesting range-bound trade over the next 24 hours.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch volatility and rates first: VIX around 19.83 is pivotal—sustained moves back above 20 would likely pressure risk assets, while a drift lower would ease conditions. The 10Y Treasury at 4.15% bears monitoring; further yield strength would likely weigh on cyclicals and the Dow, which already lagged (-0.65% 1d). Track index and futures levels for confirmation: ES at 6,755 and NQ at 25,094 need to hold steady to keep a flat-to-firm bias, while YM at 47,229 has been the weakest tape. Small caps are a tell—RTY futures at 2,396 and the Russell 2000 at 2,388; a sustained push above 2,400 would signal better breadth, while rejection there would confirm ongoing risk aversion. Monitor headline risk tied to the China growth narrative and Middle East developments cited in the news flow, as both have recently coincided with tech underperformance and firmer crude. Sector-wise, watch whether QQQ (608.86) can stabilize relative to SPY (671.93) and whether energy strength persists alongside WTI at 60.09.
