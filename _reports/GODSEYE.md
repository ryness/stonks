  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is clearly improving across equities and futures. All major US cash indices are higher on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.82%, Dow up 0.67%, and Russell 2000 up 0.82%, while the 7d moves range from about +1.8% on the Dow to +6.2% on the Russell. Index futures are even stronger, with S&P futures up 1.58%, Nasdaq futures up 1.41%, Dow futures up 2.11%, and Russell futures leading at +2.84% over 1d, signaling follow-through risk-on sentiment into the next session.
  
  Volatility and rates are generally supportive of this risk-on tone. The VIX is modestly higher on the day (+0.87%) but has collapsed nearly 30% over 7d and more than 31% over 30d to 17.34, indicating that recent stress has eased even if there is some intraday hedging. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat on the day (-0.10%) but down 3.27% over the week to about 4.00%, consistent with growing expectations of a softer Fed backdrop as reflected in recent headlines. Together, lower yields and a sharply lower VIX versus last week quantify a meaningful improvement in risk appetite.
  
  Cross-asset signals further corroborate the constructive tone, though with some defensive undertones. Gold futures are up 2.39% on the day and 2.49% over 7d, suggesting some ongoing demand for safety or inflation hedging even as equities rally. Oil is stable to slightly lower on a weekly basis (WTI -2.06% 7d), helped by ceasefire speculation weighing on crude, and the US dollar is marginally softer on the day (-0.05%) and flat on the week, removing a headwind for global risk assets. Overall, breadth (13 up vs 2 down issues) and an average 1d index gain of about 0.76% underscore that risk appetite is broadly improving rather than narrowly led.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is strong, with 13 instruments up and only 2 down, and the average 1d index move of roughly +0.76% shows gains are broad-based rather than confined to a single segment. Volatility is contained, with the VIX only slightly higher on the day but down almost 30% over the week, while the 10-year yield has drifted lower by about 3.3% over 7d to around 4.00%, providing a benign rates backdrop. Taken together, the combination of broad equity strength, lower yields, and a sharply compressed VIX points to a relatively healthy market environment with improving risk tolerance.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day and week, small caps and cyclicals are emerging as leaders while some defensives and energy-related exposure lag on a short-term basis. The Russell 2000 is a standout leader with a 1d gain of 0.82% and a very strong 7d move of 6.18%, while Russell futures are up 2.84% on the day, outpacing large-cap indices. On the downside, WTI crude oil is a notable laggard on a weekly view, down 2.06% over 7d despite being flat on the day (+0.02%), reflecting pressure from ceasefire speculation. Among major equity benchmarks, there are no clear 1d losers, but the Dow’s 1d gain of 0.67% and 7d gain of 1.80% trail the Russell’s momentum, making large-cap value a relative underperformer versus small caps in the recent window.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro policy expectations around the Federal Reserve are a key driver of the current tape. Multiple news items point to growing hopes for a December Fed rate cut and a “Fed-fueled rebound,” with articles noting that Wall Street’s rally has been reinforced by a senior Fed official signaling support for easier policy. This dovish shift has pushed Treasury yields lower over the past week (10-year down 3.27%) and helped compress the VIX by nearly 30%, directly supporting a risk-on bias across equities, particularly in growth and tech segments such as the Nasdaq and QQQ. A second major theme is the broad global equity rebound and AI/tech leadership. Headlines highlight Wall Street’s winning streak extending to four days, a “global rally in stocks” as investors look past single-name volatility in Nvidia, and an “everything rally” narrative tying AI enthusiasm to wider risk-taking. This is visible in the Nasdaq’s 1d gain of 0.82% and 7d gain of 2.23%, as well as Nasdaq futures up 1.41% on the day, and in reports of Alphabet- and Tesla-led rallies fueling tech-heavy benchmarks. The resulting sentiment is risk-on, with investors rotating back into growth and cyclicals rather than de-risking. Geopolitical and commodity dynamics are also influencing risk appetite, though in a more mixed way. Ceasefire speculation between Russia and Ukraine is described as testing oil’s floor, contributing to weaker crude prices over the week (WTI -2.06% 7d) and slightly easing inflation and cost-of-living concerns in conjunction with political budget plans aimed at cutting the cost of living. At the same time, gold’s 2.39% 1d and 2.49% 7d gains suggest some investors are still hedging geopolitical and macro risks even as equities rise, tempering but not reversing the overall risk-on tone.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the main identifiable triggers are macro and liquidity-related rather than specific corporate events. A holiday-shortened US trading week, as noted in coverage of Thanksgiving closures, implies thinner liquidity and the potential for amplified moves as delayed inflation data and other economic releases hit. Markets are also highly sensitive to any additional Federal Reserve commentary that could confirm or challenge expectations of a December rate cut, which would directly affect the 10-year yield and equity valuations. Finally, incoming global inflation or consumer data referenced in outlook pieces could either reinforce the current “softer Fed” narrative and support risk-on, or revive rate-cut doubts and pressure equities if they surprise to the upside.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The bias for the next 24 hours is moderately skewed higher. Equities show consistent strength across major indices (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.82%, Russell 2000 +0.82% on the day) and futures are trading well above cash, with S&P futures up 1.58% and Russell futures up 2.84%, indicating positive overnight sentiment. Market breadth (13 up vs 2 down), a sharply lower VIX over 7d (-29.77%), and a 10-year yield that has eased about 3.27% over the week all align with a Fed-supportive, risk-on macro backdrop cited in recent news. While gold’s strength and a small uptick in VIX today point to some caution, the weight of evidence from price action and catalysts favors a continuation of the grind higher rather than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should focus on index futures behavior and key equity levels overnight. For the S&P complex, watch whether S&P futures can hold above the recent 6,800–6,820 zone (current 6,827.25) as a proxy for sustaining the uptrend; a break back toward the 6,750–6,770 area would signal waning momentum. In small caps, Russell futures near 2,488 are leading; maintaining gains above roughly 2,450 would confirm that the 7d outperformance of the Russell 2000 (+6.18%) is intact, consistent with the projected upward bias. Sector and style leadership will also be important to monitor into the next session. The Nasdaq and QQQ, both up around 0.8–0.9% on the day, should be watched for continued strength as AI- and tech-related headlines remain supportive; persistent leadership there would reinforce risk-on, while any abrupt reversal would be an early warning. At the same time, traders should track gold futures around 4,190 and the VIX near 17.3 for signs of defensive positioning picking up; a sharp spike in VIX or further outsized gold rally alongside flat or weaker equities would argue that the bullish bias is deteriorating. On the macro side, attention should stay on the 10-year Treasury yield near 4.00% and any scheduled economic data or Fed communications referenced in the holiday-week outlooks. If incoming data and comments keep the 10-year yield grinding lower or stable and do not undermine expectations for a December rate cut, the current equity advance is more likely to extend. Conversely, a sudden back-up in yields or rhetoric that cools rate-cut hopes would be a clear signal to reassess the upward bias and watch for pressure first in rate-sensitive growth names and small caps.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Risk appetite is clearly improving across equities and futures. All major US cash indices are higher on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.82%, Dow up 0.67%, and Russell 2000 up 0.82%, while the 7d moves range from about +1.8% on the Dow to +6.2% on the Russell. Index futures are even stronger, with S&P futures up 1.58%, Nasdaq futures up 1.41%, Dow futures up 2.11%, and Russell futures leading at +2.84% over 1d, signaling follow-through risk-on sentiment into the next session.

Volatility and rates are generally supportive of this risk-on tone. The VIX is modestly higher on the day (+0.87%) but has collapsed nearly 30% over 7d and more than 31% over 30d to 17.34, indicating that recent stress has eased even if there is some intraday hedging. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat on the day (-0.10%) but down 3.27% over the week to about 4.00%, consistent with growing expectations of a softer Fed backdrop as reflected in recent headlines. Together, lower yields and a sharply lower VIX versus last week quantify a meaningful improvement in risk appetite.

Cross-asset signals further corroborate the constructive tone, though with some defensive undertones. Gold futures are up 2.39% on the day and 2.49% over 7d, suggesting some ongoing demand for safety or inflation hedging even as equities rally. Oil is stable to slightly lower on a weekly basis (WTI -2.06% 7d), helped by ceasefire speculation weighing on crude, and the US dollar is marginally softer on the day (-0.05%) and flat on the week, removing a headwind for global risk assets. Overall, breadth (13 up vs 2 down issues) and an average 1d index gain of about 0.76% underscore that risk appetite is broadly improving rather than narrowly led.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is strong, with 13 instruments up and only 2 down, and the average 1d index move of roughly +0.76% shows gains are broad-based rather than confined to a single segment. Volatility is contained, with the VIX only slightly higher on the day but down almost 30% over the week, while the 10-year yield has drifted lower by about 3.3% over 7d to around 4.00%, providing a benign rates backdrop. Taken together, the combination of broad equity strength, lower yields, and a sharply compressed VIX points to a relatively healthy market environment with improving risk tolerance.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day and week, small caps and cyclicals are emerging as leaders while some defensives and energy-related exposure lag on a short-term basis. The Russell 2000 is a standout leader with a 1d gain of 0.82% and a very strong 7d move of 6.18%, while Russell futures are up 2.84% on the day, outpacing large-cap indices. On the downside, WTI crude oil is a notable laggard on a weekly view, down 2.06% over 7d despite being flat on the day (+0.02%), reflecting pressure from ceasefire speculation. Among major equity benchmarks, there are no clear 1d losers, but the Dow’s 1d gain of 0.67% and 7d gain of 1.80% trail the Russell’s momentum, making large-cap value a relative underperformer versus small caps in the recent window.
