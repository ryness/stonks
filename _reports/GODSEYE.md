  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across major equities, the tone is risk-off with broad but not extreme selling. The S&P 500 is down 0.94% on the day and 1.61% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is weaker at -1.48% 1d and -3.30% 7d, pointing to pressure in growth and tech. The Russell 2000 is off 0.88% on the day and 0.96% on the week, suggesting small caps are participating in the pullback but less severely than large-cap tech, while the Dow is comparatively resilient at -0.37% 1d and still +0.42% 7d, indicating a defensive rotation into more cyclicals and value within equities.","Volatility and cross-asset signals corroborate fading risk appetite. The VIX is up 5.58% on the day and 12.91% over the week to 17.4, a clear pickup in implied equity risk premium even if absolute levels remain moderate. Futures markets show a milder version of the same story: S&P futures are down only 0.14% on the day and 0.94% over the week, and Nasdaq futures are off 0.73% 1d and 2.76% 7d, reflecting continued but controlled de-risking rather than a disorderly unwind. Rates are relatively stable with the 10Y Treasury yield essentially flat on the day (+0.05%) and down 0.50% over the week, while gold's 1.57% 1d and 10.75% 30d gains highlight a concurrent bid for safety, together implying risk appetite is clearly fading rather than improving.","Overall, cross-asset metrics indicate a rotation out of high-beta growth and into more defensive or real-asset exposures. The average 1d index move is about -1.02% across the equity benchmarks, while the Dow futures are bucking the trend with a 0.36% 1d gain and 1.07% 7d rise, underscoring preference for lower-volatility, cash-generative names. A modestly stronger dollar on the day (+0.16%) and firmer crude (+1.68% 1d despite being down 4.55% 7d) round out a picture of risk-taking being trimmed, with investors simultaneously probing for late-cycle and inflation-hedge exposure rather than adding to broad equity risk."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is fragile but not distressed. Breadth is negative, with 9 of 15 tracked instruments down and an average equity index decline of about 1.02% on the day, indicating a fairly broad risk-off move. The VIX has risen 5.58% today and nearly 13% over the week, signaling that investors are paying up for protection, yet the absolute level around 17.4 remains far from crisis territory. At the same time, the 10Y Treasury yield is essentially unchanged on the day and slightly lower over the week, which, combined with modest Dow and Russell resilience over 30 days, suggests a cooling rather than a breakdown in overall market health.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Dow 30 is the relative leader among major U.S. indices, down only 0.37%, with its futures contract actually up 0.36%, while the Russell 2000 is also holding up modestly better than growth at -0.88% 1d. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is a clear laggard with a -1.48% 1d move, mirrored by QQQ at -1.56% 1d, highlighting sustained pressure on large-cap tech. Over the past week, the Dow's +0.42% gain versus the Nasdaq's -3.30% and QQQ's -3.54% underscores a rotation away from high-beta growth into more defensive, value-oriented benchmarks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro data around U.S. employment is a key driver of the tape. Headlines note that the November jobs report was delayed and then delivered mixed signals, with payrolls rising but unemployment jumping to 4.6%, the highest since 2021, which investors see as pivotal for the interest-rate path next year. This uncertainty has contributed to the S&P 500's 0.94% daily drop and the Dow's slide, as markets reassess growth durability versus the likelihood and timing of Fed easing, a combination that is leaning risk-off in the short term while supporting a bid in Treasuries over the past week."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% confidence – The near-term bias is modestly lower given that all major U.S. equity indices except the Dow are down around 0.9% to 1.5% on the day and show negative 7d momentum, with the Nasdaq off 3.30% over the week and the S&P 500 down 1.61%. Volatility is rising, as the VIX is up 5.58% today and nearly 13% over the week, and gold is catching a strong bid (+1.57% 1d, +4.41% 7d), both consistent with increased hedging and risk reduction. While Dow futures are modestly positive and the 10Y yield is stable to slightly lower over a week, suggesting no acute macro shock, the combination of weak breadth, tech leadership to the downside, and ongoing digestion of mixed jobs data tilts the balance toward further de-risking over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should monitor whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can stabilize near current levels or extend their recent downtrends, with attention on S&P E-mini futures around 6,800 and Nasdaq futures near 25,000 as psychological reference points. Persistent underperformance in QQQ (down 1.56% 1d and 3.54% 7d) versus the more resilient Dow futures (+0.36% 1d, +1.07% 7d) will be important for gauging whether the rotation out of high-multiple tech into value and cyclicals continues, which would reinforce a downside bias for growth-heavy benchmarks.","Cross-asset indicators also warrant close watching: the VIX near 17.4 after a 5.58% daily jump will signal whether hedging demand keeps building, while gold futures, up 1.57% on the day and over 10% in 30 days, will show if safe-haven flows intensify further. In rates, the 10Y Treasury yield hovering around 4.15% with a slight weekly decline will help indicate whether bond markets are validating equity concerns about growth; any sharp move lower in yields alongside further equity weakness would confirm a deeper risk-off tone consistent with the expected "down" bias."
