  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a strong risk-on cash session with broad gains: S&P 500 +1.54%, Nasdaq Composite +2.27%, Dow +0.81%, and Russell 2000 +0.94%, with breadth positive (11 up, 4 down) and the average index change at +1.56%. This indicates improving risk appetite during the day, led by growth/tech (QQQ +2.21%) and supported by modest cyclical participation.
  
  The risk tone softened into the overnight, as volatility rose and futures slipped: VIX +2.27% to 18.00 (7d +3.21%, 30d +10.57%), while S&P futures -0.22%, Nasdaq futures -0.40%, Dow futures -0.04%, and Russell futures -0.17%. The combination of a higher VIX and red futures suggests some fading of risk appetite after the cash-session rally.
  
  Rates and macro cues were mixed: the 10Y Treasury yield ticked up to 4.11% (+0.42% 1d; -0.75% 30d) and the US Dollar was flat (+0.02% 1d), while gold firmed (+0.86% 1d; +7.97% 30d) and oil was little changed on the day (+0.43% 1d but -3.17% 30d). These metrics point to a cautious backdrop that may temper follow-through despite the equity strength.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is constructive but not unambiguous. Breadth favored bulls (11 up vs 4 down) and the average index move was a solid +1.56%, led by growth. However, the VIX rose to 18.00 (+2.27% 1d) and the 10Y yield edged up to 4.11% (+0.42% 1d), which caps enthusiasm. On balance, the tape is healthy in the cash market, with a cautious overlay from higher implied volatility and slightly firmer rates.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to tech and growth: the Nasdaq Composite was a clear standout at +2.27% 1d (QQQ +2.21%), while the Dow lagged on a relative basis at +0.81% 1d. Over the week, leadership is less clear with S&P 500 only +0.15% 7d and laggards including the Russell 2000 (-0.42% 7d) and Dow 30 (-0.32% 7d). A negative near-term standout was Nasdaq futures at -0.40% 1d, contrasting with the cash-session tech strength.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Progress toward ending the U.S. government shutdown is a key macro driver, with reports highlighting a 60–40 Senate procedural vote on a short-term funding deal and global shares rising on optimism that a resolution is in sight. This has supported a risk-on bias in cash trading, aligning with the broad equity gains and improved breadth. At the same time, valuation and positioning concerns in Big Tech/AI linger following last week’s “sense check,” as reflected in recent tech-led weakness and weekly softness (Nasdaq Composite -0.23% 7d; Nasdaq futures -1.51% 7d). This overhang helps explain the higher VIX (18.00; +3.21% 7d) and softer overnight futures despite today’s tech-led bounce. The macro crosscurrents include steady-to-firmer yields (10Y at 4.11%, +0.42% 1d) and resilience in gold (+4.14% 7d), suggesting some hedging alongside risk-taking. These factors create a mixed risk backdrop: shutdown optimism leans risk-on, while elevated implied volatility and persistent tech valuation concerns lean risk-off.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. confidence data is on tap and could sway risk sentiment, especially for rate-sensitive and growth exposures; a stronger print may lift yields and test equity multiples, while a softer print could ease yields and support defensives. Additionally, headlines on U.S. government funding negotiations remain a key swing factor for risk assets given the recent boost from shutdown-resolution optimism.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 58% — The cash session was decisively risk-on (S&P 500 +1.54%, Nasdaq +2.27%, breadth 11/4), but the VIX rose to 18.00 (+2.27% 1d) and index futures are modestly lower (ES -0.22%, NQ -0.40%), with the 10Y yield nudging up to 4.11%. Shutdown optimism supports dips, while elevated implied vol and weekly tech softness argue for consolidation ahead of the U.S. confidence data.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures for tone into the open: S&P futures near 6,842, Nasdaq futures around 25,611, and Russell futures near 2,460; a turn back to green would validate dip-buying, while continued softness would argue for range-bound trade consistent with a flat bias. Monitor volatility and rates as the swing variables: VIX at 18.00 versus the prior 17.60 reference, and the 10Y yield at 4.11% versus recent reference points (7d 4.093%, 30d 4.141%). A VIX drift lower and 10Y contained below ~4.14% would support stability; a push higher in either would pressure equities. Focus on tech leadership durability and breadth: QQQ at 623.23 and the Nasdaq Composite at 23,527 led today, while small caps lagged; sustained leadership with broader participation would underpin the tape. Into the U.S. confidence print, also track USD at 99.64 and gold at 4,147 for confirmation of risk tone.
