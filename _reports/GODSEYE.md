  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is risk-on with broad gains and easing volatility. The S&P 500 is up 0.88% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +1.31%, and the Russell 2000 is higher by 0.86%, while average index change over the day is a solid +0.94% with 13 assets up versus only 2 down. This equity strength is echoed in ETFs, with SPY up 0.91% and QQQ up 1.30%.","Volatility signals confirm improving risk appetite: the VIX dropped 11.62% on the day to 14.91 and is down nearly 12% over the week and 17% over the month, indicating investors are paying less for downside protection. At the same time, S&P and Nasdaq futures are modestly higher on the day (+0.27% and +0.42% respectively) even though they remain lower over the past week (-1.38% and -2.58%), suggesting short-term stabilization after recent weakness.","Rates and cross-asset moves show a nuanced backdrop but do not yet negate the risk-on tone. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15% but is roughly flat over a week (-0.31%), while gold has rallied 9.59% over 30 days and 3.93% over 7 days, hinting at some lingering demand for hedges. Overall, however, the combination of rising equities, falling VIX, and mildly higher futures points to improving near-term risk appetite despite mixed signals from rates and commodities."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong in the near term based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive with 13 instruments up and only 2 down, and the average index move of about +0.94% indicates a broad-based advance rather than a narrow rally. The sharp 11.62% drop in the VIX to 14.91 points to reduced stress and supportive risk sentiment. Even with the 10Y yield ticking up 0.85% on the day to 4.15%, the combination of solid equity gains and calmer volatility suggests a generally healthy market backdrop for now.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is coming from growth and large-cap tech: the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.31% on the day and QQQ rose 1.30%, outperforming the S&P 500's +0.88% and the Dow's +0.38%. Small caps are participating, with the Russell 2000 up 0.86%, but not leading. On the downside, the main laggard today is the Russell futures contract, which is essentially flat at -0.02% despite spot Russell strength, and Russell Fut is also one of the weakest on a 7-day basis at -2.12%. This points to futures pricing more caution in small caps relative to the stronger tone in mega-cap and tech benchmarks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The tape is being driven primarily by macro data pointing to easing inflation in the U.S., which has boosted expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts and supported global risk assets. News that cooling U.S. CPI has lifted Asian equities and backed the case for Fed easing aligns with the day's broad equity gains and lower VIX, reinforcing a risk-on narrative. This backdrop encourages investors to add equity exposure and compresses volatility as the perceived policy path turns more supportive.","Another key macro theme is shifting global central bank policy, particularly in Japan. Reports of the Bank of Japan lifting its benchmark rate and Japan's 10-year yield briefly touching 2% have "lifted Asian risk appetite," with Bitcoin and ether also trading higher in response. This suggests that, despite tighter policy in Japan, markets are interpreting the move as a sign of economic normalization rather than a threat, contributing to a constructive tone for risk assets globally.","Regionally, confidence in emerging and international markets is being bolstered by the same U.S. inflation dynamics, as highlighted by the Indian market rally driven by lower U.S. inflation and Fed-cut hopes. This cross-regional pickup in risk appetite helps validate the strength seen in U.S. benchmarks and underpins the drop in volatility. Together, these macro themes skew the tape toward risk-on positioning, even as some defensive assets like gold remain firm over the past month."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term triggers mentioned in the data are limited, but a few events could influence sentiment over the next 24 hours. The ongoing reaction to the recent U.S. CPI print and evolving expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts will remain central, as markets digest how quickly policy might ease. In Asia, follow-through from the Bank of Japan's rate hike decision and moves in Japan's 10-year yield around 2% could impact global bond markets and risk assets. Additionally, scheduled earnings such as FedEx and Darden Restaurants (flagged as upcoming in the news flow) may shape sector-specific tone and broader risk sentiment if results diverge from expectations, though their impact is likely more micro than macro.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%), very strong breadth (13 up vs 2 down), and a sharp 11.62% drop in the VIX to 14.91 indicating improved risk appetite. Futures are also slightly positive (S&P Fut +0.27%, Nasdaq Fut +0.42%), and global news flow around cooling U.S. inflation and supportive Fed-cut expectations tilts the macro narrative toward risk-on. The slightly higher 10Y yield and elevated gold prices temper the call, so an extension higher is more likely to be incremental rather than explosive.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether index futures can hold and build on today's gains, with S&P futures around 6,796.5 and Nasdaq futures near 25,132.8 serving as key reference zones for sentiment. Sustained strength above these areas would confirm follow-through on the risk-on move anchored by the S&P 500's +0.88% and Nasdaq's +1.31% cash gains, while any sharp reversal alongside a rebound in the VIX from 14.9 would be an early warning of fading risk appetite.","Sector-wise, focus should remain on large-cap tech and growth proxies like QQQ, which outperformed at +1.30%, and on small caps via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures given their divergence today (spot Russell +0.86% vs Russell Fut -0.02%). On the macro side, traders should monitor the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15% for any abrupt moves that could challenge the equity rally, as well as ongoing headlines about U.S. inflation, Fed-cut expectations, and the market's reaction to Japan's rate hike, all of which are currently anchoring the constructive bias."]
