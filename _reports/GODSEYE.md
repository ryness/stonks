  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite faded notably as equities sold off broadly: S&P 500 -1.66%, Dow -1.65%, Nasdaq -2.29%, and Russell 2000 -2.77%, with ETFs echoing the move (SPY -1.66%, QQQ -2.04%). The average index change was -2.01% on the day, underscoring a synchronized risk-off tone.
  
  Volatility firmed with the VIX at 20.00, up 14.22% on the day and up 20.26% over 30 days, signaling heightened demand for protection. Futures tracked the decline: S&P -1.56% (ES), Nasdaq -1.97% (NQ), Dow -1.56% (YM), and Russell -2.64% (RTY), confirming weak overnight risk tone.
  
  Rates added pressure as the 10Y Treasury yield rose 1.16% to 4.11. Commodities were mixed: WTI crude gained 2.50% while gold eased 0.62% on the day (though gold remains +5.85% over 7d). The US Dollar dipped 0.26% on the day but remains +1.40% over 30d, a backdrop that, alongside higher yields and vol, caps risk appetite.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak. Breadth shows 3 up vs 12 down and the average index change was -2.01% today, indicating broad participation in the decline. The VIX jumped 14.22% to 20.00, and the 10Y yield rose to 4.11% (+1.16% 1d), a combination consistent with risk-off conditions. Against that volatility/treasury backdrop, the tape looks fragile rather than resilient near term.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed defensive-to-energy on the day, with WTI crude up +2.50% as a rare positive standout, while small caps lagged materially with the Russell 2000 down -2.77% 1d. Over the week, the Dow 30 is a relative leader at +0.79% while the Nasdaq Composite is a laggard at -2.05%, reflecting weakness in growth/tech versus more diversified large caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Markets are reacting to uncertainty around the fallout from the US government shutdown, which Yahoo reports is muddying the picture for rate cuts. That aligns with a risk-off posture across equities and a 1.16% rise in the 10Y to 4.11, alongside a 14.22% spike in VIX to 20.00, all of which typically dampen risk appetite. Cautious global tone is reinforced by reports that Asian markets opened subdued as investors await economic data and Federal Reserve policy signals. This wait-and-see stance maps to weaker US equity futures (ES -1.56%, NQ -1.97%), supporting a near-term risk-off bias until clearer policy or data cues emerge. Energy dynamics are also in focus, with multiple reports of oil strength and today’s data showing WTI +2.50%. While higher oil can pressure inflation expectations (risk-off for duration-sensitive assets), it can provide relative support to energy-linked equities, creating a mixed but generally cautious macro impulse.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% — Broad declines across major indices (S&P -1.66%, Nasdaq -2.29%, Russell -2.77%), weaker futures (ES -1.56%, NQ -1.97%), rising VIX (+14.22% to 20.00), and a higher 10Y yield (+1.16% to 4.11) alongside shutdown-related uncertainty point to a risk-off bias over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures levels for follow-through: ES near 6,768 and NQ around 25,118; sustained trade below these areas would corroborate downside momentum, with small caps (RTY ~2,395) as the risk barometer given their -2.64% futures drop. Monitor volatility and rates: a VIX hold above 20.00 alongside a 10Y yield pressing higher from 4.11 would likely keep pressure on high-duration assets like tech (QQQ -2.04% today) and small caps (Russell 2000 -2.77%). Track energy as a relative leader: if WTI crude (~59.95, +2.50% 1d) stays firm, energy sectors could outperform even if the broader tape stays weak. Headlines tied to US shutdown fallout and any Fed policy signals should be watched for shifts in rate-cut expectations that could alter risk tone.
