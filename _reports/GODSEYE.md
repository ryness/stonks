  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities and futures, the tone is risk-on for the day but still consolidating over the past week. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.90% on the day, while SPY and QQQ gain 0.72% and 0.88%, respectively; S&P and Nasdaq futures mirror this with 0.67% and 0.84% advances. However, on a 7-day basis, major U.S. benchmarks are modestly negative (S&P 500 -0.47%, Nasdaq -0.94%, Dow -1.12%), indicating that today's rally is improving risk appetite but mainly clawing back recent losses rather than starting a new leg higher.
  
  Volatility and rates are generally supportive of the improved risk tone. The VIX is down 5.64% on the day to 19.09, signaling fading near-term equity stress, though it remains higher over 7 and 30 days (+7.31% and +24.12%), which shows background caution has not fully abated. The 10Y Treasury yield is nearly flat on the day (+0.27%) and lower on the week and month (-1.47% and -1.26%), suggesting rates are not pressuring risk assets and are instead providing a stable backdrop for equities.
  
  Cross-asset signals show a mix of risk-on and defensive behavior. Crude oil is roughly flat on the day (-0.06%) after a strong 30-day run (+18.57%), while gold is firmly higher both today (+1.68%) and over 30 days (+13.71%), indicating persistent demand for hedges alongside the equity bid. Overall, with average index gains around 0.60% today and 10 assets up versus 5 down, risk appetite is improving in the short term, but elevated volatility and continued strength in gold point to only a cautious, not full-throttle, risk-on environment.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately constructive in the near term. Breadth is positive with 10 assets up versus 5 down, and the average index move of roughly +0.60% over 1 day indicates a broad-based advance across large-cap benchmarks. The VIX is easing sharply today (-5.64%) and the 10Y Treasury yield is stable to slightly lower on a multi-week basis, which reduces macro headwinds. However, the VIX remains about 24% higher than 30 days ago and gold is up 13.71% over that span, signaling that while today's tape is healthy, underlying risk perceptions remain elevated.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90% and QQQ up 0.88%, outpacing the S&P 500's 0.69% and the Dow's 0.47%. Futures show a similar pattern, with Nasdaq futures (+0.84%) leading S&P futures (+0.67%) and Dow futures (+0.44%). On the lagging side, small caps are the standout underperformers: the Russell 2000 is down 0.05% on the day and Russell futures are essentially flat at -0.01%, and volatility remains relatively elevated on a 30-day view, with the VIX up 24.12% despite today's decline.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A key macro and geopolitical driver today is reduced trade risk for U.S. large-cap growth and tech names. News indicates that a U.S. Supreme Court decision blocking major Trump tariffs has fueled a rally in the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq, with the Nasdaq up 0.90% and the S&P 500 up 0.69% as investors bid up Amazon (+2% per report) and Nvidia (over +1%), along with the broader Magnificent Seven cohort. This development clearly tilts the tape toward risk-on behavior, particularly in tech and consumer sectors that are sensitive to trade policy and global supply chains. At the same time, safe-haven and real-asset performance suggests investors are still hedging macro and geopolitical uncertainties. Gold futures are up 1.68% on the day and a strong 13.71% over 30 days, while WTI crude has surged 18.57% over the past month, pointing to persistent concerns about inflation, supply dynamics, or geopolitical tensions, even if they are not explicitly detailed in the headlines here. This combination of tech-led equity strength and elevated gold and oil prices reflects a risk-on equity reaction to specific positive news (tariff relief) layered on top of a broader environment where investors still value protection against macro shocks. Micro-level news is also influencing sentiment at the margin. The Nasdaq notification to NaaS Technology about minimum market value deficiency is a company-specific governance and listing-risk story, and the notice explicitly states there is no immediate impact on trading, so it is unlikely to be a broad market catalyst. Overall, today's dominant driver is the easing of trade/tariff risk boosting U.S. megacap tech and retail, which supports risk-on flows, while the underlying macro backdrop, as inferred from gold and volatility trends, remains cautiously defensive.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, as today's session shows broad-based gains in major indices (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%, Dow +0.47%) and corresponding futures (S&P +0.67%, Nasdaq +0.84%, Dow +0.44%), supported by a sharp pullback in near-term volatility (VIX -5.64%) and a benign rates backdrop (10Y yield nearly flat on the day and lower over 7–30 days). The main identified catalyst, the Supreme Court blocking major tariffs, is clearly positive for large-cap tech and consumer names, and that theme is currently driving leadership. Confidence is tempered by the fact that indices are still down over the past week and month in several cases and the VIX and gold remain elevated on a 30-day basis, indicating lingering macro caution that could cap follow-through.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should monitor whether S&P and Nasdaq futures can sustain today's gains into the next session, with S&P futures around 6,923 and Nasdaq futures near 25,068 serving as key reference zones for follow-through or mean reversion. A continued bid in QQQ (+0.88% today) versus SPY (+0.72%) would confirm that megacap tech leadership tied to tariff relief is intact, while any reversal in that spread could hint at fading enthusiasm for the trade headline. The behavior of the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, both flat to slightly negative on the day, is also important: renewed weakness in small caps despite the positive macro news would underscore that risk-on sentiment is still selective rather than broad. On the macro side, the VIX at 19.09 after a 5.64% drop is a key gauge to watch; further easing toward the mid-teens would validate the bullish bias, while a quick snap back higher would signal that today's optimism is fragile. The 10Y Treasury yield, currently near 4.09% and down on a 7- and 30-day horizon, should also be tracked for any sudden backup that could pressure equity multiples, particularly in long-duration tech. Finally, the persistence of strength in gold (5,059.30, +13.71% over 30 days) and crude (66.39, +18.57% over 30 days) will help traders gauge whether underlying macro risk and inflation concerns are reasserting themselves, which could challenge the expected upward drift in equities.

## 1. Pulse

Across equities and futures, the tone is risk-on for the day but still consolidating over the past week. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.90% on the day, while SPY and QQQ gain 0.72% and 0.88%, respectively; S&P and Nasdaq futures mirror this with 0.67% and 0.84% advances. However, on a 7-day basis, major U.S. benchmarks are modestly negative (S&P 500 -0.47%, Nasdaq -0.94%, Dow -1.12%), indicating that today's rally is improving risk appetite but mainly clawing back recent losses rather than starting a new leg higher.

Volatility and rates are generally supportive of the improved risk tone. The VIX is down 5.64% on the day to 19.09, signaling fading near-term equity stress, though it remains higher over 7 and 30 days (+7.31% and +24.12%), which shows background caution has not fully abated. The 10Y Treasury yield is nearly flat on the day (+0.27%) and lower on the week and month (-1.47% and -1.26%), suggesting rates are not pressuring risk assets and are instead providing a stable backdrop for equities.

Cross-asset signals show a mix of risk-on and defensive behavior. Crude oil is roughly flat on the day (-0.06%) after a strong 30-day run (+18.57%), while gold is firmly higher both today (+1.68%) and over 30 days (+13.71%), indicating persistent demand for hedges alongside the equity bid. Overall, with average index gains around 0.60% today and 10 assets up versus 5 down, risk appetite is improving in the short term, but elevated volatility and continued strength in gold point to only a cautious, not full-throttle, risk-on environment.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately constructive in the near term. Breadth is positive with 10 assets up versus 5 down, and the average index move of roughly +0.60% over 1 day indicates a broad-based advance across large-cap benchmarks. The VIX is easing sharply today (-5.64%) and the 10Y Treasury yield is stable to slightly lower on a multi-week basis, which reduces macro headwinds. However, the VIX remains about 24% higher than 30 days ago and gold is up 13.71% over that span, signaling that while today's tape is healthy, underlying risk perceptions remain elevated.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.90% and QQQ up 0.88%, outpacing the S&P 500's 0.69% and the Dow's 0.47%. Futures show a similar pattern, with Nasdaq futures (+0.84%) leading S&P futures (+0.67%) and Dow futures (+0.44%). On the lagging side, small caps are the standout underperformers: the Russell 2000 is down 0.05% on the day and Russell futures are essentially flat at -0.01%, and volatility remains relatively elevated on a 30-day view, with the VIX up 24.12% despite today's decline.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** A key macro and geopolitical driver today is reduced trade risk for U.S. large-cap growth and tech names. News indicates that a U.S. Supreme Court decision blocking major Trump tariffs has fueled a rally in the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq, with the Nasdaq up 0.90% and the S&P 500 up 0.69% as investors bid up Amazon (+2% per report) and Nvidia (over +1%), along with the broader Magnificent Seven cohort. This development clearly tilts the tape toward risk-on behavior, particularly in tech and consumer sectors that are sensitive to trade policy and global supply chains. At the same time, safe-haven and real-asset performance suggests investors are still hedging macro and geopolitical uncertainties. Gold futures are up 1.68% on the day and a strong 13.71% over 30 days, while WTI crude has surged 18.57% over the past month, pointing to persistent concerns about inflation, supply dynamics, or geopolitical tensions, even if they are not explicitly detailed in the headlines here. This combination of tech-led equity strength and elevated gold and oil prices reflects a risk-on equity reaction to specific positive news (tariff relief) layered on top of a broader environment where investors still value protection against macro shocks. Micro-level news is also influencing sentiment at the margin. The Nasdaq notification to NaaS Technology about minimum market value deficiency is a company-specific governance and listing-risk story, and the notice explicitly states there is no immediate impact on trading, so it is unlikely to be a broad market catalyst. Overall, today's dominant driver is the easing of trade/tariff risk boosting U.S. megacap tech and retail, which supports risk-on flows, while the underlying macro backdrop, as inferred from gold and volatility trends, remains cautiously defensive.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, as today's session shows broad-based gains in major indices (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%, Dow +0.47%) and corresponding futures (S&P +0.67%, Nasdaq +0.84%, Dow +0.44%), supported by a sharp pullback in near-term volatility (VIX -5.64%) and a benign rates backdrop (10Y yield nearly flat on the day and lower over 7–30 days). The main identified catalyst, the Supreme Court blocking major tariffs, is clearly positive for large-cap tech and consumer names, and that theme is currently driving leadership. Confidence is tempered by the fact that indices are still down over the past week and month in several cases and the VIX and gold remain elevated on a 30-day basis, indicating lingering macro caution that could cap follow-through.

3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should monitor whether S&P and Nasdaq futures can sustain today's gains into the next session, with S&P futures around 6,923 and Nasdaq futures near 25,068 serving as key reference zones for follow-through or mean reversion. A continued bid in QQQ (+0.88% today) versus SPY (+0.72%) would confirm that megacap tech leadership tied to tariff relief is intact, while any reversal in that spread could hint at fading enthusiasm for the trade headline. The behavior of the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, both flat to slightly negative on the day, is also important: renewed weakness in small caps despite the positive macro news would underscore that risk-on sentiment is still selective rather than broad. On the macro side, the VIX at 19.09 after a 5.64% drop is a key gauge to watch; further easing toward the mid-teens would validate the bullish bias, while a quick snap back higher would signal that today's optimism is fragile. The 10Y Treasury yield, currently near 4.09% and down on a 7- and 30-day horizon, should also be tracked for any sudden backup that could pressure equity multiples, particularly in long-duration tech. Finally, the persistence of strength in gold (5,059.30, +13.71% over 30 days) and crude (66.39, +18.57% over 30 days) will help traders gauge whether underlying macro risk and inflation concerns are reasserting themselves, which could challenge the expected upward drift in equities.
