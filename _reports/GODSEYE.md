  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a tentative risk-on tilt on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.13%, Dow up 0.16%, and Russell 2000 leading at +0.58%, while the Nasdaq Composite lags at -0.21%; breadth is supportive with 11 up, 3 down, and 1 flat, and the average index change is a modest +0.07%. This follows a weak week-to-date backdrop where the Nasdaq is down 3.98% and the S&P 500 is down 2.35%, signaling that near-term risk appetite is improving but still healing from recent losses.
  
  Volatility has eased on the day as the VIX fell 2.15% to 19.08, but it remains elevated versus the past week (+12.77%) and month (+24.79%), indicating lingering caution despite today’s stabilization. Rates are steady with the 10Y Treasury yield flat on the day at 4.09% and up 0.86% over the week, a backdrop that is not adding fresh pressure but also not yet signaling an all-clear.
  
  Futures point higher with S&P (+0.76%), Nasdaq (+1.28%), Dow (+0.24%), and Russell (+0.74%) all up, suggesting improved risk appetite heading into the next session. Cross-asset signals are mixed with gold up 1.51% on the day and oil up 0.92% but still down 4.96% over 30 days, while the US Dollar is marginally firmer (+0.04% 1d), collectively consistent with a cautious but stabilizing risk tone.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive in the very near term. Breadth is positive at 11 up versus 3 down and 1 flat, and the average index change is a small +0.07%, implying mild buying interest. However, the VIX at 19.08 is up 12.77% over the week and 24.79% over the month, signaling elevated risk premia. The 10Y Treasury yield at 4.09% is unchanged on the day but higher on the week, which tempers the improvement seen in equities.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to cyclicals and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.58% and the Dow up 0.16%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.21% and QQQ slipped 0.32%. Over the last week, the Dow is the relative outperformer at -1.35%, while the Nasdaq is the laggard at -3.98%, underscoring tech’s recent pressure versus more diversified benchmarks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI and semiconductor headlines are weighing on tech sentiment after Nvidia’s CEO said there are no plans to sell chips in China due to restrictions from Beijing and Washington, which pressured the stock and the broader theme. This aligns with the recent worst tech sell-off since April and helps explain the Nasdaq’s -3.98% 7d versus the Dow’s -1.35%, a risk-off bias within mega-cap growth even as broader indices stabilize. Macro uncertainty around U.S. economic signs and a cooling labor market, alongside concerns cited in week-ahead coverage, has contributed to a cautious tone. That backdrop fits with a VIX that is down 2.15% on the day but still up 12.77% over the week, indicating that while markets are attempting to stabilize, risk premia remain elevated due to growth and policy uncertainties. Valuation concerns and a global chip selloff cited in recent coverage have amplified downside pressure in high-multiple tech, reinforcing the week’s underperformance in the Nasdaq versus other benchmarks. This dynamic has pushed investors toward selective risk, as seen in small-cap resilience today and continued interest in gold, which is up 1.51% on the day and 6.26% over the month.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%: Index futures are higher (ES +0.76%, NQ +1.28%, RTY +0.74%), breadth improved (11 up, 3 down, 1 flat), and the VIX eased 2.15% on the day, pointing to a stabilization bid, though elevated weekly volatility and recent tech-led drawdowns cap confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P 500 cash at 6,728.80 and ES at 6,805 can hold gains into the open and keep VIX contained near 19; sustained trade with VIX below the 20 area would support the risk-on bias. Small caps at 2,432.82 led today; continued relative strength there would confirm broader participation. Monitor Nasdaq leadership for follow-through with NQ futures up 1.28% against the prior day’s softness in QQQ (-0.32%); stabilization in semis and AI-linked names would be a key tell for extending the bounce given the recent tech-driven weakness (Nasdaq -3.98% 7d). Keep an eye on macro signposts: the 10Y Treasury at 4.09% (flat 1d, +0.86% 7d) and the US Dollar at 99.64 (+0.04% 1d) alongside gold at 4,059.90 (+1.51% 1d) and WTI at 60.30 (+0.92% 1d); a benign rates backdrop with steady dollar and calmer vol would align with the anticipated upward bias.
