  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities ended mixed with the S&P 500 -0.05% on the day, the Dow 30 -0.65%, the Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, and the Russell 2000 +0.22%. Breadth showed 9 up vs 6 down and the average index change was -0.05%, pointing to a mostly flat tape with a slight negative skew. On a 7d basis risk appetite has faded, with the S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, and Russell 2000 -3.11%.
  
  Volatility eased marginally today but remains elevated: VIX 19.83 (-0.85% 1d) is still up 10.11% over 7d and 19.10% over 30d, signaling lingering stress. Index futures leaned cautiously risk-on into the close (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%) while Dow futures lagged (YM -0.58%), indicating a tentative bid skewed toward growth and small caps.
  
  Rates firmed as the 10Y Treasury yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d), a headwind for duration-sensitive equities, while the US dollar edged +0.09%. Commodities were mixed with WTI crude +2.15% and gold -2.45%, dynamics that can temper any improvement in risk appetite given the rate backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral-to-fragile. Breadth at 9 up vs 6 down with an average index change of -0.05% describes a mostly flat session with a slight negative tilt. Volatility remains elevated with VIX at 19.83 (down 0.85% today but up 10.11% over 7d), and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d), both of which constrain risk-taking. Taken together, conditions suggest stabilization rather than robust strength.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 +0.22% and Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the past week, small caps and tech have led the downside (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq -2.55%), with the Dow comparatively resilient at -0.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global headlines flag a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy following an unprecedented slump in investment, aligning with the 7d drawdowns in the Nasdaq (-2.55%) and Russell 2000 (-3.11%). This backdrop leans risk-off, though today’s modest rebounds in the Nasdaq (+0.13%) and QQQ (+0.08%) suggest selective dip-buying. Reports noting Wall Street’s worst day in a month and concerns about stretched US tech valuations are consistent with the VIX being up 10.11% over 7d and Nasdaq futures -2.33% over 7d. That keeps a lid on risk appetite even as near-term futures were slightly higher today (NQ +0.21%). China’s ‘extreme disappointment’ toward a Dutch minister in a car-chip row highlights ongoing semiconductor supply-chain tensions, introducing headline risk for chips and broader growth proxies. In parallel, today’s rise in crude (+2.15%) and the 10Y yield (+0.88%) can reinforce inflation and rate concerns, skewing the macro tone toward risk-off if sustained.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — Signals are mixed: modest green in ES (+0.08%), NQ (+0.21%), and RTY (+0.38%) versus YM (-0.58%); breadth 9/6 but average index change -0.05%; VIX remains elevated at 19.83 (7d +10.11%) and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d), while headlines around China and tech keep a risk-averse tone.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch ES=F around 6,760–6,765 and NQ=F near 25,095–25,148; holding above today’s reference levels (ES 6,760; NQ 25,094.75) would support a flat-to-firm open, while slips below would argue for renewed pressure. Monitor VIX versus the 20 handle (last 19.83) and the 10Y Treasury near 4.15; a VIX push back above 20 or yields extending beyond today’s +0.88% rise would likely cap equities given the week’s drawdowns. On leadership, track Nasdaq and small caps for stabilization signals (Nasdaq Composite last 22,900.59; Russell 2000 last 2,388.23), and stay alert to headlines on China’s economy and the chip supply row given their recent pressure on growth proxies.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-14T22:47:12.858329+00:00">2025-11-14 22:47 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 41s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities ended mixed with the S&P 500 -0.05% on the day, the Dow 30 -0.65%, the Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, and the Russell 2000 +0.22%. Breadth showed 9 up vs 6 down and the average index change was -0.05%, pointing to a mostly flat tape with a slight negative skew. On a 7d basis risk appetite has faded, with the S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, and Russell 2000 -3.11%.

Volatility eased marginally today but remains elevated: VIX 19.83 (-0.85% 1d) is still up 10.11% over 7d and 19.10% over 30d, signaling lingering stress. Index futures leaned cautiously risk-on into the close (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%) while Dow futures lagged (YM -0.58%), indicating a tentative bid skewed toward growth and small caps.

Rates firmed as the 10Y Treasury yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d), a headwind for duration-sensitive equities, while the US dollar edged +0.09%. Commodities were mixed with WTI crude +2.15% and gold -2.45%, dynamics that can temper any improvement in risk appetite given the rate backdrop.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral-to-fragile. Breadth at 9 up vs 6 down with an average index change of -0.05% describes a mostly flat session with a slight negative tilt. Volatility remains elevated with VIX at 19.83 (down 0.85% today but up 10.11% over 7d), and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d), both of which constrain risk-taking. Taken together, conditions suggest stabilization rather than robust strength.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership tilted to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 +0.22% and Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the past week, small caps and tech have led the downside (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq -2.55%), with the Dow comparatively resilient at -0.35%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global headlines flag a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy following an unprecedented slump in investment, aligning with the 7d drawdowns in the Nasdaq (-2.55%) and Russell 2000 (-3.11%). This backdrop leans risk-off, though today’s modest rebounds in the Nasdaq (+0.13%) and QQQ (+0.08%) suggest selective dip-buying. Reports noting Wall Street’s worst day in a month and concerns about stretched US tech valuations are consistent with the VIX being up 10.11% over 7d and Nasdaq futures -2.33% over 7d. That keeps a lid on risk appetite even as near-term futures were slightly higher today (NQ +0.21%). China’s ‘extreme disappointment’ toward a Dutch minister in a car-chip row highlights ongoing semiconductor supply-chain tensions, introducing headline risk for chips and broader growth proxies. In parallel, today’s rise in crude (+2.15%) and the 10Y yield (+0.88%) can reinforce inflation and rate concerns, skewing the macro tone toward risk-off if sustained.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — Signals are mixed: modest green in ES (+0.08%), NQ (+0.21%), and RTY (+0.38%) versus YM (-0.58%); breadth 9/6 but average index change -0.05%; VIX remains elevated at 19.83 (7d +10.11%) and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% 1d), while headlines around China and tech keep a risk-averse tone.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch ES=F around 6,760–6,765 and NQ=F near 25,095–25,148; holding above today’s reference levels (ES 6,760; NQ 25,094.75) would support a flat-to-firm open, while slips below would argue for renewed pressure. Monitor VIX versus the 20 handle (last 19.83) and the 10Y Treasury near 4.15; a VIX push back above 20 or yields extending beyond today’s +0.88% rise would likely cap equities given the week’s drawdowns. On leadership, track Nasdaq and small caps for stabilization signals (Nasdaq Composite last 22,900.59; Russell 2000 last 2,388.23), and stay alert to headlines on China’s economy and the chip supply row given their recent pressure on growth proxies.
