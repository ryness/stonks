  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across major U.S. equities, the tone is mildly risk-on but with very small headline moves. The S&P 500 is up 0.05% on the day and 0.61% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.06% on the day but still down 2.91% over 30 days, showing that recent tech weakness lingers despite a short-term stabilization. The Russell 2000 is notably stronger with a 2.77% gain over 7 days and 5.62% over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite toward smaller caps even as large-cap growth remains under pressure.","Volatility and futures confirm a cautious but improving risk tone. The VIX is down 2.28% on the day and 7.53% over the week, though still about 38.7% higher than 30 days ago at 20.13, indicating that fear has eased recently but remains elevated versus last month. Equity futures lean constructive, with S&P futures up 0.17% on the day and 0.60% over the week and Dow futures up 0.09% on the day and 1.26% over the week, while Nasdaq futures are slightly lower on the day (-0.13%) and down 2.42% over 30 days, underscoring that risk appetite is improving but remains more selective and less supportive for growth-heavy tech.","Rates and cross-asset signals are supportive of this cautious risk-on stance. The 10-year Treasury yield has edged down 0.10% on the day and about 3.75% over the week to 4.05, easing some rate pressure on valuations. Meanwhile, gold has pulled back 2.49% on the day after a strong 13.51% rise over 30 days and WTI crude is off 0.97% on the day but up 8.65% over 30 days, consistent with some profit-taking in havens and commodities after a recent risk-off stretch. Overall, risk appetite is modestly improving, with breadth slightly positive and the average index change around +0.02% today, but the elevated one-month VIX and still-weak Nasdaq point to lingering caution rather than a full-throttle risk-on environment."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears moderately constructive but not euphoric. Breadth is slightly positive, with 9 assets up and 6 down, and the average index-level move over the last day is a muted +0.02%, suggesting a stabilizing rather than surging tape. Volatility has eased over the week, with the VIX down 7.53%, while the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen about 3.75% over the same period to 4.05, both of which reduce macro stress on equities. However, the VIX remains almost 39% higher than a month ago and the Nasdaq is still down nearly 3% over 30 days, so the market looks healthier than during the recent spike in fear but not fully out of the woods.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day and week, leadership has tilted toward cyclicals and smaller caps, while large-cap growth lags. The Russell 2000 is a clear standout with a 1-day gain of 0.09% and a 7-day move of 2.77%, and Dow futures are also relatively strong with a 1-day rise of 0.09% and a 7-day gain of 1.26%. On the downside, QQQ is a notable laggard with a 1-day decline of 0.25% and a 30-day drop of 2.07%, and Nasdaq futures are down 0.13% on the day and 2.42% over 30 days, highlighting ongoing pressure in tech and growth relative to value and small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Recent macro and geopolitical drivers in the supplied news flow are largely non-U.S. and sector-specific, with Indian equity markets showing sharp swings tied to sector rotation and AI-related fears. One article notes that the Sensex and Nifty rebounded strongly with gains of roughly 0.82–0.83%, which reflects a localized risk-on response tied to strength in financial, energy, and pharma stocks; while this is not a direct U.S. driver, it illustrates that global risk sentiment can recover quickly after regional sell-offs. Another piece highlights prior weakness in Indian IT and metals, attributed to concerns over AI disruption and sector-specific headwinds, which is indicative of a broader risk-off bias toward technology that is consistent with the underperformance of QQQ and Nasdaq futures over the last month in the U.S. data.","Additionally, global commentary captured in the search results describes a recent "Friday the 13th" global selloff in stocks and gold associated with heightened AI fears, followed by signals that the selloff may have been overdone. This aligns with the current pattern of an elevated one-month VIX (+38.7%) but a 7-day decline in volatility and modest equity gains, suggesting markets are transitioning from a fear-driven risk-off to a tentative buy-the-dip phase. Overall, the macro theme inferred from the data is that AI-related disruption concerns have pressured tech globally, but easing yields, recovering indices, and softer volatility over the past week are slowly shifting the tape back toward cautious risk-on positioning."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete U.S.-specific forward events are not detailed in the provided data or headlines, so the next 24 hours appear to hinge mainly on ongoing digestion of prior volatility, sector rotation away from tech, and how markets respond to the recent easing in rates and volatility; without explicit mentions of scheduled major earnings, data releases, or central bank decisions, the identifiable catalysts are limited to continued reaction to AI-disruption narratives and global equity swings, so specific upcoming triggers are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence; the S&P 500, Dow, and Russell 2000 are all modestly higher on the day and up over the past week, while VIX has fallen 2.28% on the day and 7.53% over the week and the 10-year yield is lower by about 3.75% over seven days, creating a supportive backdrop for equities. Futures are aligned with this bias, with S&P and Dow futures both positive on the day and week, and Russell futures showing particularly strong 7-day and 30-day gains, pointing to sustained demand for cyclicals and small caps. Nasdaq vehicles remain soft over 30 days, but today's small positive in the cash Nasdaq Composite and slightly negative Nasdaq futures suggest more consolidation than renewed downside, so the overall balance of evidence favors a modestly higher tape rather than a decline or flatline.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should focus on whether the S&P 500 and S&P futures can build on their incremental gains, with S&P futures already up 0.17% on the day and 0.60% over the week and the cash index up 0.05% on the day. Sustained strength in the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which are up 2.77% and 2.58% over the week respectively and over 5% on a 30-day basis, would confirm the rotation into smaller caps that supports the "up" bias, while any reversal there would challenge the constructive view.","Sector-wise, continued underperformance in tech-linked benchmarks like QQQ (down 0.25% on the day and 2.07% over 30 days) and Nasdaq futures (down 2.42% over 30 days) versus the Dow and Russell will be key to gauging whether the rally broadens or stays narrow. On the macro side, watch the VIX, which has retreated 7.53% over the week but sits at 20.13, and the 10-year yield at 4.05; further softening in either would reinforce risk-on conditions, while a renewed spike in volatility or backup in yields could quickly cap the upside implied by today's tentative improvement."]

## 1. Pulse

["Across major U.S. equities, the tone is mildly risk-on but with very small headline moves. The S&P 500 is up 0.05% on the day and 0.61% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.06% on the day but still down 2.91% over 30 days, showing that recent tech weakness lingers despite a short-term stabilization. The Russell 2000 is notably stronger with a 2.77% gain over 7 days and 5.62% over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite toward smaller caps even as large-cap growth remains under pressure.","Volatility and futures confirm a cautious but improving risk tone. The VIX is down 2.28% on the day and 7.53% over the week, though still about 38.7% higher than 30 days ago at 20.13, indicating that fear has eased recently but remains elevated versus last month. Equity futures lean constructive, with S&P futures up 0.17% on the day and 0.60% over the week and Dow futures up 0.09% on the day and 1.26% over the week, while Nasdaq futures are slightly lower on the day (-0.13%) and down 2.42% over 30 days, underscoring that risk appetite is improving but remains more selective and less supportive for growth-heavy tech.","Rates and cross-asset signals are supportive of this cautious risk-on stance. The 10-year Treasury yield has edged down 0.10% on the day and about 3.75% over the week to 4.05, easing some rate pressure on valuations. Meanwhile, gold has pulled back 2.49% on the day after a strong 13.51% rise over 30 days and WTI crude is off 0.97% on the day but up 8.65% over 30 days, consistent with some profit-taking in havens and commodities after a recent risk-off stretch. Overall, risk appetite is modestly improving, with breadth slightly positive and the average index change around +0.02% today, but the elevated one-month VIX and still-weak Nasdaq point to lingering caution rather than a full-throttle risk-on environment."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears moderately constructive but not euphoric. Breadth is slightly positive, with 9 assets up and 6 down, and the average index-level move over the last day is a muted +0.02%, suggesting a stabilizing rather than surging tape. Volatility has eased over the week, with the VIX down 7.53%, while the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen about 3.75% over the same period to 4.05, both of which reduce macro stress on equities. However, the VIX remains almost 39% higher than a month ago and the Nasdaq is still down nearly 3% over 30 days, so the market looks healthier than during the recent spike in fear but not fully out of the woods.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day and week, leadership has tilted toward cyclicals and smaller caps, while large-cap growth lags. The Russell 2000 is a clear standout with a 1-day gain of 0.09% and a 7-day move of 2.77%, and Dow futures are also relatively strong with a 1-day rise of 0.09% and a 7-day gain of 1.26%. On the downside, QQQ is a notable laggard with a 1-day decline of 0.25% and a 30-day drop of 2.07%, and Nasdaq futures are down 0.13% on the day and 2.42% over 30 days, highlighting ongoing pressure in tech and growth relative to value and small caps.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Recent macro and geopolitical drivers in the supplied news flow are largely non-U.S. and sector-specific, with Indian equity markets showing sharp swings tied to sector rotation and AI-related fears. One article notes that the Sensex and Nifty rebounded strongly with gains of roughly 0.82–0.83%, which reflects a localized risk-on response tied to strength in financial, energy, and pharma stocks; while this is not a direct U.S. driver, it illustrates that global risk sentiment can recover quickly after regional sell-offs.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence; the S&P 500, Dow, and Russell 2000 are all modestly higher on the day and up over the past week, while VIX has fallen 2.28% on the day and 7.53% over the week and the 10-year yield is lower by about 3.75% over seven days, creating a supportive backdrop for equities. Futures are aligned with this bias, with S&P and Dow futures both positive on the day and week, and Russell futures showing particularly strong 7-day and 30-day gains, pointing to sustained demand for cyclicals and small caps. Nasdaq vehicles remain soft over 30 days, but today's small positive in the cash Nasdaq Composite and slightly negative Nasdaq futures suggest more consolidation than renewed downside, so the overall balance of evidence favors a modestly higher tape rather than a decline or flatline.

Sustained strength in the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which are up 2.77% and 2.58% over the week respectively and over 5% on a 30-day basis, would confirm the rotation into smaller caps that supports the "up" bias, while any reversal there would challenge the constructive view.","Sector-wise, continued underperformance in tech-linked benchmarks like QQQ (down 0.25% on the day and 2.07% over 30 days) and Nasdaq futures (down 2.42% over 30 days) versus the Dow and Russell will be key to gauging whether the rally broadens or stays narrow. On the macro side, watch the VIX, which has retreated 7.53% over the week but sits at 20.13, and the 10-year yield at 4.05; further softening in either would reinforce risk-on conditions, while a renewed spike in volatility or backup in yields could quickly cap the upside implied by today's tentative improvement."]
