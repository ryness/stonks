  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Equities show a clear risk-on tone today. The S&P 500 is up 0.77% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +1.04%, and small caps via the Russell 2000 are leading at +1.20%. Over the past week, all three are positive (S&P 500 +0.84%, Nasdaq +1.18%, Russell 2000 +1.40%), indicating that risk appetite is improving on a short-term basis despite modest 30-day drawdowns in the large-cap and tech benchmarks.",
      "Volatility and futures confirm this constructive backdrop. The VIX fell 6.95% on the day and 6.10% over the week, signaling easing hedging demand even though it remains about 35% higher than 30 days ago, which keeps an undercurrent of caution. Equity index futures are higher across the board (S&P +0.92%, Nasdaq +1.38%, Russell +1.21% on the day), reinforcing that buyers are willing to add exposure overnight.",
      "Rates and cross-asset signals are supportive but not euphoric. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat on the day (+0.10%) and lower over 7 and 30 days (−1.73% and −3.31%), providing a benign rate backdrop for equities. At the same time, strong 30-day gains in gold (+15.76%) and crude (+11.74%), alongside a still-elevated VIX, show that while risk appetite is improving in the very near term, some investors continue to seek hedges and inflation or geopolitical insurance."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks broadly constructive based on today's benchmark moves. Breadth is strong, with 12 assets up versus only 3 down and an average index/futures change near +0.93% over 1 day. Volatility is moving in the right direction for bulls, with the VIX down nearly 7% today and the 10-year yield stable around 4.03% after drifting lower over the past month, which limits rate shock risk. The main caveat is that the VIX is still about 35% above its 30-day level, suggesting the market is healthier short term but not entirely out of the woods.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is in small caps and growth/tech. The Russell 2000 is a notable outperformer with a 1.20% 1-day gain, and the QQQ ETF is up 1.07%, outpacing the broader SPY at +0.73%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 (+1.40%) and Nasdaq-related benchmarks (Nasdaq Composite +1.18%, Nasdaq futures +1.35%) are leading, while the Dow 30 is lagging with a 1-day gain of 0.76% but a 7-day loss of 0.56%. On the downside, defensive or haven-like assets are softer today, with WTI crude down 0.38% and gold futures down 0.13% on the day despite their strong 7- and 30-day runs.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "Tariff and trade headlines remain an important macro overhang. Recent coverage highlights that trade war fears and higher tariff threats from U.S. leadership have driven sharp equity selloffs and sector-specific pain, particularly in prior sessions where the Dow dropped more than 1.5% and the so‑called "Magnificent Seven" were hit. This backdrop tends to be risk-off when new tariff threats surface, but today's rebound in U.S. benchmarks and lower VIX suggest that, for now, markets are looking through immediate tariff concerns and leaning back toward risk-on positioning.",
      "Geopolitical tensions and energy dynamics are another key theme. News flows reference U.S.-Iran tensions that recently pressured global equities and lifted traditional havens like gold and oil; this is consistent with the strong 30-day rallies in gold (+15.76%) and WTI crude (+11.74%). That pattern indicates that while equities are bouncing, a parallel bid for commodities is acting as a hedge against geopolitical flare-ups, tempering how decisively investors can embrace a pure risk-on stance.",
      "Global growth and policy expectations are influencing rates and broader risk-taking. Articles citing weaker U.S. GDP growth and debates over labor market data align with the 10-year yield easing 3.31% over 30 days, which in turn supports equity valuations and today's broad-based index gains. At the same time, commentary about central bank watching and data-dependent outlooks keeps some uncertainty priced in, reflected in a VIX that, despite its 6.95% drop today, remains elevated versus a month ago, balancing risk-on equity flows with residual macro caution."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets could react to scheduled macro data and central bank-related commentary highlighted in recent coverage, such as U.S. inflation and GDP updates that prior futures notes flagged as key drivers, as well as any follow-on remarks from Federal Reserve officials like Governor Waller after his recent labor-market-focused speech. Developments around U.S. tariff policy and trade headlines, which have recently sparked large intraday swings, will also be important catalysts, with any escalation skewing risk-off and any de-escalation supporting the current rebound. Additionally, global policy decisions like China's loan prime rate setting, referenced in Asia market previews, could influence overnight futures and risk sentiment into the next U.S. session.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence; Broad U.S. equity benchmarks and futures are all higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.77%, Nasdaq +1.04%, Russell 2000 +1.20%, S&P futures +0.92%, Nasdaq futures +1.38%), breadth is strong (12 up vs 3 down), and the VIX is down nearly 7%, pointing to improving risk appetite. A stable-to-lower 10-year yield over the past week and month provides a supportive rate backdrop. However, elevated gold and oil and a VIX still ~35% above 30-day levels, alongside ongoing tariff and geopolitical headlines, limit conviction and leave some downside risk, keeping confidence moderate rather than high.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Overnight, traders should monitor whether equity index futures can hold or extend today's gains, particularly S&P futures around the 6,900 handle and Nasdaq futures near 25,100, as sustaining these levels would support an upside bias into the next cash session. The relative performance of small caps versus large caps via Russell futures at roughly 2,650 will help confirm whether today's pro-cyclical leadership persists or fades, which is important for judging the strength of the risk-on move implied by our 'up' bias.",
      "Macro-wise, attention should stay on any fresh tariff headlines or geopolitical updates that could quickly reverse the current easing in volatility, given the VIX is still elevated at 19.55 despite its sharp daily drop. Traders should also watch the 10-year Treasury yield around 4.03% for signs of renewed upward pressure, which could undermine growth and tech leadership, as well as gold and crude price action to gauge whether hedging demand is intensifying or cooling in step with the anticipated equity strength."

    "Equities show a clear risk-on tone today. The S&P 500 is up 0.77% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +1.04%, and small caps via the Russell 2000 are leading at +1.20%.

The Russell 2000 is a notable outperformer with a 1.20% 1-day gain, and the QQQ ETF is up 1.07%, outpacing the broader SPY at +0.73%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 (+1.40%) and Nasdaq-related benchmarks (Nasdaq Composite +1.18%, Nasdaq futures +1.35%) are leading, while the Dow 30 is lagging with a 1-day gain of 0.76% but a 7-day loss of 0.56%. On the downside, defensive or haven-like assets are softer today, with WTI crude down 0.38% and gold futures down 0.13% on the day despite their strong 7- and 30-day runs.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** [
    "Tariff and trade headlines remain an important macro overhang. Recent coverage highlights that trade war fears and higher tariff threats from U.S. leadership have driven sharp equity selloffs and sector-specific pain, particularly in prior sessions where the Dow dropped more than 1.5% and the so‑called "Magnificent Seven" were hit.

Developments around U.S. tariff policy and trade headlines, which have recently sparked large intraday swings, will also be important catalysts, with any escalation skewing risk-off and any de-escalation supporting the current rebound. Additionally, global policy decisions like China's loan prime rate setting, referenced in Asia market previews, could influence overnight futures and risk sentiment into the next U.S. session.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence; Broad U.S. equity benchmarks and futures are all higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.77%, Nasdaq +1.04%, Russell 2000 +1.20%, S&P futures +0.92%, Nasdaq futures +1.38%), breadth is strong (12 up vs 3 down), and the VIX is down nearly 7%, pointing to improving risk appetite. A stable-to-lower 10-year yield over the past week and month provides a supportive rate backdrop. However, elevated gold and oil and a VIX still ~35% above 30-day levels, alongside ongoing tariff and geopolitical headlines, limit conviction and leave some downside risk, keeping confidence moderate rather than high.

3.2. **Watch List:** [
    "Overnight, traders should monitor whether equity index futures can hold or extend today's gains, particularly S&P futures around the 6,900 handle and Nasdaq futures near 25,100, as sustaining these levels would support an upside bias into the next cash session. The relative performance of small caps versus large caps via Russell futures at roughly 2,650 will help confirm whether today's pro-cyclical leadership persists or fades, which is important for judging the strength of the risk-on move implied by our 'up' bias.",
    "Macro-wise, attention should stay on any fresh tariff headlines or geopolitical updates that could quickly reverse the current easing in volatility, given the VIX is still elevated at 19.55 despite its sharp daily drop. Traders should also watch the 10-year Treasury yield around 4.03% for signs of renewed upward pressure, which could undermine growth and tech leadership, as well as gold and crude price action to gauge whether hedging demand is intensifying or cooling in step with the anticipated equity strength."
