  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Across major equity benchmarks, the tone is risk-on with broad gains and a modest rebound from recent weakness. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day but still down 0.95% over the past week, while the Nasdaq Composite has risen 0.91% today against a 1.85% decline over seven days, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.85% today with a marginal 0.12% weekly gain. The Dow 30 shows steadier leadership, up 0.60% on the day and 0.38% over the week, suggesting large caps are providing relative stability after a recent tech-led pullback.",
      "Volatility and futures pricing reinforce an improving risk appetite versus recent sessions. The VIX has dropped 8.36% today and 8.68% over the week to 15.46, indicating reduced demand for protection as indices bounce. Equity futures are stronger than the cash close, with S&P futures up 1.44%, Nasdaq futures up 2.03%, Dow futures up 1.17%, and Russell futures up 1.37% on the day, pointing to follow-through buying interest and a constructive near-term tone.",
      "Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed but still consistent with a cautiously positive risk backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield has edged up 0.70% on the day to 4.15% yet is down 0.46% over the week, suggesting that the largest recent move has been toward slightly easier long-end conditions. At the same time, gold is up 0.79% today and 9.90% over 30 days, and the US dollar is modestly softer over 30 days (-1.13%), indicating lingering demand for hedges even as equity risk appetite improves in the very short term."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the near term. Breadth is strong, with 14 instruments up and only 1 down, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.76% shows a broad-based advance rather than a narrow mega-cap squeeze. Volatility has compressed meaningfully, with the VIX down 8.36% today and 14.16% over 30 days to 15.46, which is consistent with a calmer regime. The 10-year Treasury yield is only modestly higher on the day and slightly lower over the week, so the rate backdrop is not yet pushing back sharply against this equity strength.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and small caps: the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.91% and the Russell 2000 is up 0.85%, while QQQ is a standout ETF with a 1.08% 1-day gain. On a weekly view, the Dow 30 is a relative leader, up 0.38% over 7 days, while the S&P 500 (-0.95%) and especially the Nasdaq Composite (-1.85%) and QQQ (-1.90%) have lagged due to recent tech weakness. Within futures, Nasdaq futures are the standout on the day with a 2.03% jump, whereas Russell futures are still slightly negative over the week (-0.76%) despite today's 1.37% bounce.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "The dominant macro driver is the latest US CPI report showing the largest monthly inflation decline in two years and an easing in November CPI, which markets are interpreting as supportive for a friendlier interest-rate path. News that stocks jumped on easing consumer inflation and that this data could help set expectations for rates directly aligns with today's broad equity gains and the sharp drop in VIX. Lower inflation pressure generally supports a risk-on bias by reducing fears of further tightening, which is consistent with the rally across major indices and futures.",
      "At the same time, the inflation narrative is complicated by tariffs and cost pressures, as reports highlight that President Trump's new tariffs have pushed up business costs even as headline inflation has recently declined. This mix of easing CPI but tariff-related input cost concerns creates a push-pull dynamic: it is broadly risk-supportive in the immediate term via lower reported inflation, but it adds medium-term uncertainty about margins and growth. For now, the tape suggests investors are focusing more on the dovish implications of the CPI print than on the longer-run tariff overhang.",
      "Global macro and central bank narratives are also shaping sentiment around risk assets. Coverage notes that the dollar is broadly firm in the very near term as markets brace for central bank decisions in Britain, Europe, and Japan, and that multiple central bank meetings could underscore policy divergence, while separate commentary points to markets weighing jobs data signals and oil moves. These themes tend to inject event risk that can be mildly risk-off around decision time, but the concurrent strength in US equity futures and the drop in VIX indicate that, at least for now, investors are treating them as manageable rather than destabilizing catalysts."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets are likely to key off residual reactions to the recent US CPI release, as investors further refine expectations for the path of interest rates. Multiple central bank decisions in Europe, the UK, and Japan, as flagged by coverage of traders bracing for a "central bank bonanza," could shift global rate differentials and drive moves in the US dollar and risk assets. In the US corporate space, earnings reports from companies like FedEx and Darden Restaurants, which are scheduled to report tomorrow, may influence sentiment around consumer demand and logistics, with any surprises either reinforcing or challenging the current risk-on tone.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The 1-day tape is broadly positive with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.91%, and Russell 2000 up 0.85%, while futures show even stronger gains (e.g., Nasdaq futures +2.03% and S&P futures +1.44%), and breadth is very strong at 14 up vs 1 down. Volatility has compressed sharply, with the VIX down 8.36% today to 15.46, signaling reduced demand for hedges. The key macro catalyst, a notable easing in CPI, is being interpreted as supportive for the rate outlook, which aligns with the risk-on equity response; the main counterpoint is a modest uptick in the 10-year yield and elevated gold, which temper conviction but do not yet dominate price action.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Into the next session, traders should watch whether equity futures can hold their current premium over cash, particularly S&P futures around 6,876 and Nasdaq futures near 25,538, as a gauge of follow-through buying. Tech and growth leadership is central to the move, with QQQ up 1.08% and Nasdaq benchmarks outperforming on the day, so sustained strength or reversal in large-cap tech will be critical for validating an "up" bias. Monitoring the VIX around the mid-teens is also important; if it remains near 15.5 or compresses further, it would confirm a constructive risk backdrop.",
      "Macro-wise, attention should stay on bond yields and central bank headlines as markets digest the big CPI downside surprise. The 10-year Treasury near 4.15% has only moved modestly; a renewed drop in yields would further support equities, while an unexpected spike could challenge the current rally. Traders should also track moves in the US dollar around 98.6 and in gold near 4,374, as any sharp risk-off shift in those hedging assets would be an early warning that the positive equity reaction to inflation data is fading.",
      "Sector and style rotation will be another key theme to monitor given the recent contrast between weak 7-day tech performance and today's growth-led rebound. The Russell 2000 and Russell futures, up 0.85% and 1.37% on the day respectively but still only slightly positive to negative over the week, are important barometers of whether risk-on appetite is broadening beyond mega caps. If small caps and cyclicals continue to participate alongside large-cap growth, it would support the view that the current advance has room to extend into the next session."

### Latest news (0-3 days)

## 1. Pulse

[
    "Across major equity benchmarks, the tone is risk-on with broad gains and a modest rebound from recent weakness. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day but still down 0.95% over the past week, while the Nasdaq Composite has risen 0.91% today against a 1.85% decline over seven days, and the Russell 2000 is up 0.85% today with a marginal 0.12% weekly gain. The Dow 30 shows steadier leadership, up 0.60% on the day and 0.38% over the week, suggesting large caps are providing relative stability after a recent tech-led pullback.",
    "Volatility and futures pricing reinforce an improving risk appetite versus recent sessions. The VIX has dropped 8.36% today and 8.68% over the week to 15.46, indicating reduced demand for protection as indices bounce. Equity futures are stronger than the cash close, with S&P futures up 1.44%, Nasdaq futures up 2.03%, Dow futures up 1.17%, and Russell futures up 1.37% on the day, pointing to follow-through buying interest and a constructive near-term tone.",
    "Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed but still consistent with a cautiously positive risk backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield has edged up 0.70% on the day to 4.15% yet is down 0.46% over the week, suggesting that the largest recent move has been toward slightly easier long-end conditions. At the same time, gold is up 0.79% today and 9.90% over 30 days, and the US dollar is modestly softer over 30 days (-1.13%), indicating lingering demand for hedges even as equity risk appetite improves in the very short term."
  ]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the near term. Breadth is strong, with 14 instruments up and only 1 down, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.76% shows a broad-based advance rather than a narrow mega-cap squeeze. Volatility has compressed meaningfully, with the VIX down 8.36% today and 14.16% over 30 days to 15.46, which is consistent with a calmer regime. The 10-year Treasury yield is only modestly higher on the day and slightly lower over the week, so the rate backdrop is not yet pushing back sharply against this equity strength.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and small caps: the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.91% and the Russell 2000 is up 0.85%, while QQQ is a standout ETF with a 1.08% 1-day gain. On a weekly view, the Dow 30 is a relative leader, up 0.38% over 7 days, while the S&P 500 (-0.95%) and especially the Nasdaq Composite (-1.85%) and QQQ (-1.90%) have lagged due to recent tech weakness. Within futures, Nasdaq futures are the standout on the day with a 2.03% jump, whereas Russell futures are still slightly negative over the week (-0.76%) despite today's 1.37% bounce.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** [
    "The dominant macro driver is the latest US CPI report showing the largest monthly inflation decline in two years and an easing in November CPI, which markets are interpreting as supportive for a friendlier interest-rate path. News that stocks jumped on easing consumer inflation and that this data could help set expectations for rates directly aligns with today's broad equity gains and the sharp drop in VIX. Lower inflation pressure generally supports a risk-on bias by reducing fears of further tightening, which is consistent with the rally across major indices and futures.",
    "At the same time, the inflation narrative is complicated by tariffs and cost pressures, as reports highlight that President Trump's new tariffs have pushed up business costs even as headline inflation has recently declined. This mix of easing CPI but tariff-related input cost concerns creates a push-pull dynamic: it is broadly risk-supportive in the immediate term via lower reported inflation, but it adds medium-term uncertainty about margins and growth. For now, the tape suggests investors are focusing more on the dovish implications of the CPI print than on the longer-run tariff overhang.",
    "Global macro and central bank narratives are also shaping sentiment around risk assets. Coverage notes that the dollar is broadly firm in the very near term as markets brace for central bank decisions in Britain, Europe, and Japan, and that multiple central bank meetings could underscore policy divergence, while separate commentary points to markets weighing jobs data signals and oil moves. These themes tend to inject event risk that can be mildly risk-off around decision time, but the concurrent strength in US equity futures and the drop in VIX indicate that, at least for now, investors are treating them as manageable rather than destabilizing catalysts."
  ]

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets are likely to key off residual reactions to the recent US CPI release, as investors further refine expectations for the path of interest rates. Multiple central bank decisions in Europe, the UK, and Japan, as flagged by coverage of traders bracing for a "central bank bonanza," could shift global rate differentials and drive moves in the US dollar and risk assets. In the US corporate space, earnings reports from companies like FedEx and Darden Restaurants, which are scheduled to report tomorrow, may influence sentiment around consumer demand and logistics, with any surprises either reinforcing or challenging the current risk-on tone.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The 1-day tape is broadly positive with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.91%, and Russell 2000 up 0.85%, while futures show even stronger gains (e.g., Nasdaq futures +2.03% and S&P futures +1.44%), and breadth is very strong at 14 up vs 1 down. Volatility has compressed sharply, with the VIX down 8.36% today to 15.46, signaling reduced demand for hedges. The key macro catalyst, a notable easing in CPI, is being interpreted as supportive for the rate outlook, which aligns with the risk-on equity response; the main counterpoint is a modest uptick in the 10-year yield and elevated gold, which temper conviction but do not yet dominate price action.

Tech and growth leadership is central to the move, with QQQ up 1.08% and Nasdaq benchmarks outperforming on the day, so sustained strength or reversal in large-cap tech will be critical for validating an "up" bias.

Traders should also track moves in the US dollar around 98.6 and in gold near 4,374, as any sharp risk-off shift in those hedging assets would be an early warning that the positive equity reaction to inflation data is fading.",
    "Sector and style rotation will be another key theme to monitor given the recent contrast between weak 7-day tech performance and today's growth-led rebound. The Russell 2000 and Russell futures, up 0.85% and 1.37% on the day respectively but still only slightly positive to negative over the week, are important barometers of whether risk-on appetite is broadening beyond mega caps.
