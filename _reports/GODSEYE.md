  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a modestly firmer tone on the day but remain weaker on the week, signaling tentative risk appetite. The S&P 500 rose 0.13% and the Dow gained 0.16%, while the Russell 2000 outperformed at +0.58% and the Nasdaq Composite lagged at -0.21%; breadth leaned positive (9 up, 5 down, 1 flat) with an average index change of +0.07%. On a 7-day view, risk appetite has faded with the S&P 500 -2.35% and the Nasdaq -3.98%.
  
  Futures echo the rotation: S&P futures +0.09%, Dow futures +0.12%, Russell futures +0.54%, and Nasdaq futures -0.31% on the day, while over the week Nasdaq futures are -4.17% versus S&P futures -2.44%. Volatility eased today with VIX -2.15% to 19.08, but remains elevated versus a week (+12.77%) and month (+24.79%), underscoring lingering caution.
  
  Rates and commodities are mixed but not flashing stress today: the 10Y Treasury yield is flat on the day at 4.09% (+0.86% 7d, -2.25% 30d). Gold is firm (futures +0.75% 1d, +6.21% 30d) and crude bounced (+0.54% 1d) but is still -9.08% over 30 days; the US Dollar dipped -0.17% on the day. Cross-asset signals suggest intraday stabilization but a still-defensive backdrop over the week.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously neutral. Breadth favored advancers (9 up, 5 down, 1 flat) and the average index change was a modest +0.07%, indicating stabilization rather than a decisive risk-on. However, VIX at 19.08 is lower on the day (-2.15%) but materially higher over the week (+12.77%), and the 10Y yield held flat at 4.09% after a weekly uptick (+0.86%), keeping risk premia sticky. With major benchmarks down 1.35% to 3.98% over the week, the tape looks resilient intraday but not broadly healthy.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day, while the Dow also outperformed on a relative basis at +0.16%. Growth and mega-cap tech lagged, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.21% and QQQ -0.32% on the day; over the week, Nasdaq futures fell 4.17% versus the Dow’s smaller 1.49% decline, marking clear underperformance from tech.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A valuation reset in AI and semiconductors is driving the tape, with multiple reports highlighting a tech-led sell-off and concerns about stretched expectations for AI beneficiaries. Coverage points to a global chip drawdown and tech volatility, consistent with the Nasdaq’s 7-day declines of 3.98% and Nasdaq futures -4.17%, reinforcing a risk-off impulse concentrated in growth sectors. Macro caution stems from signs of a cooling U.S. labor market and policy uncertainty, which have investors “watching U.S. economic signals” as markets pull back. Headlines citing deteriorating jobs data align with the weekly rise in VIX (+12.77%) and support a defensive bid in gold (+0.66% 7d), tilting the broader tone toward risk-off despite today’s steadier rates. Markets did manage to come off lows into the end of the week as participants weighed headlines alongside softer data, mirroring VIX easing on the day (-2.15%) and modest gains in the S&P 500 (+0.13%). This suggests tactical dip-buying outside mega-cap tech, but not enough to reverse the broader weekly de-risking.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. consumer sentiment/confidence data is on tap within the next 24 hours, which could sway growth expectations and move yields and cyclicals. Fed speak is also flagged, with remarks potentially affecting rate expectations and equity volatility given VIX’s elevated weekly profile.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 58% The day’s mild gains in the S&P 500 (+0.13%) and Dow (+0.16%) alongside small-cap strength (+0.58%) are offset by persistent tech underperformance (Nasdaq -0.21%, NQ=F -0.31% 1d; -4.17% 7d) and an elevated weekly VIX (+12.77%). Futures are mixed (ES=F +0.09%, NQ=F -0.31%) and the 10Y is flat at 4.09%, pointing to balance ahead of consumer sentiment and Fed speak.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech versus small-cap relative performance: Nasdaq futures at 25,166 versus S&P futures at 6,753.75 and Russell futures at 2,440.60. Continued NQ underperformance would cap broader upside, while sustained RTY strength would confirm rotation that supports a flat-to-rangebound tape. Monitor volatility and rates as the quickest read on risk: VIX around 19.08 needs to stay contained for stability, and the 10Y at 4.09% remaining steady would help. Track U.S. consumer sentiment/confidence and any Fed remarks; a soft sentiment print or hawkish tone could pressure growth proxies, while a benign outcome would favor continued chop with gold at 4,009.8 and the dollar at 99.56 as additional sentiment gauges.
