  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Risk appetite is clearly improving across assets. Major U.S. equity indices are higher on the day with the S&P 500 up 0.43%, Dow 0.39%, Nasdaq 0.33%, and small caps leading with the Russell 2000 up 1.73%. Volatility is compressing, with the VIX down 3.44% on the day and more than 31% over the week to 16.02, signaling a significant easing in hedging demand as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have gained 3.87% and 5.47% respectively over the past week.","Equity futures confirm a strong risk-on tone into the next session: S&P futures are up 2.24% on the day, Nasdaq futures 2.93%, Dow futures 3.21%, and Russell futures 3.87%. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield is modestly lower on the day (-0.71% to 4.06%) and flat over the week, while the U.S. dollar index is down 0.51% on the day and 1.32% over the week, providing a supportive backdrop for risk assets.","Cross-asset flows show some defensive interest but alongside broad risk-on behavior. Gold futures are up 3.68% on the day and 3.79% over the week, suggesting demand for hedges or safe assets even as equities rally. Crude is relatively muted (WTI +0.27% on the day, -1.81% over the week), implying the risk-on tone is more about financial conditions and tech-led sentiment than a strong cyclical growth impulse."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive with 12 instruments up versus 3 down, and the average 1-day index gain of about 0.61% shows broad participation rather than a narrow rally. Volatility is retreating sharply, with the VIX down 3.44% on the day and over 31% on the week to 16.02, indicating calmer conditions. A slightly lower 10-year yield on the day (-0.71% to 4.06%) adds to a constructive backdrop for equities without signaling acute growth concern.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is concentrated in small caps and cyclicals, with the Russell 2000 up 1.73% and Russell futures up 3.87%, outpacing the S&P 500's 0.43% and Nasdaq's 0.33% gains. Over the week, growth/tech remains a key leader, with the Nasdaq Composite up 5.47% and QQQ up 5.76% versus the S&P 500's 3.87%. On the negative side, energy is a laggard with WTI crude nearly flat on the day (+0.27%) and down 1.81% over the week, while the U.S. dollar is also soft, down 0.51% on the day and 1.32% on the week, reflecting weaker defensive demand.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and sentiment drivers center on shifting risk appetite after a crypto-led risk-off wobble. Recent headlines highlight that U.S. stocks had their first loss in six days as Bitcoin tumbled and tech showed weakness, but subsequent reports note that the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq are edging higher as Wall Street "regains its footing" and the "flight from risk starts to cool." This aligns with today's broad equity gains and falling VIX, reinforcing a risk-on shift as investors look past recent crypto volatility.","Crypto remains an important sentiment swing factor. News flow points to Bitcoin plunging around 6% in early Asia and broader worries about downside risks for Bitcoin and other tokens, with related tech stocks "taking a battering." However, later reports indicate Bitcoin has steadied and even bounced, helping U.S. indices edge higher with names like Nvidia leading tech sentiment. This translates into improving risk appetite in equities, particularly in growth areas, despite ongoing structural concerns about crypto leverage and quantum-computing risks.","Global equity dynamics and profit-taking behavior also frame the tape. Indian markets, for example, are cited as pulling back from record highs on profit-taking and foreign selling, while U.S. markets are described as consolidating after strong gains but supported by expectations of easier financial conditions and ongoing AI-related enthusiasm in tech. This backdrop is consistent with a U.S.-centric risk-on tone today, complemented by modestly lower Treasury yields and a softer dollar that ease financial conditions without a clear new macro data catalyst in the last 24 hours."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key potential triggers over the next 24 hours are centered on scheduled U.S. corporate earnings and further crypto price action rather than named macro data or policy events in the provided context. Marvell's upcoming report is explicitly flagged in headlines as an event investors are watching, which could move semiconductor and broader tech sentiment. Additionally, news flow repeatedly cites Bitcoin and crypto volatility as a major driver for risk appetite, so any renewed sharp move in Bitcoin prices could quickly influence tech-adjacent equities and futures. No specific Fed speeches or major economic releases are identified in the supplied data.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% — The base case is modest upside over the next 24 hours. Spot indices are already positive (S&P 500 +0.43%, Nasdaq +0.33%, Russell 2000 +1.73%) and futures are signaling stronger follow-through (S&P futures +2.24%, Nasdaq futures +2.93%, Dow futures +3.21%, Russell futures +3.87%). The VIX is down 3.44% on the day and over 31% on the week, while the 10-year yield and U.S. dollar are both softer, indicating easing financial conditions. News flow shows the market "regaining its footing" after crypto-driven risk-off, which supports a bias for further gains, though the recent run-up and lingering crypto and tech valuation concerns temper confidence from being higher.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch how U.S. equity futures behave around current highs, particularly S&P futures near 6,871.5 and Nasdaq futures near 25,678.75, as these levels now anchor the short-term uptrend. Small caps are an important tell for follow-through: Russell 2000 cash at 2,507.58 and Russell futures at 2,512.30 have led on the day, so sustained strength there would confirm broadening risk-on rather than a narrow mega-cap rally, especially with VIX holding near 16 or lower.","Sector-wise, tech and crypto-linked names remain key given their role in recent volatility. Headlines highlight that Nvidia-led tech gains and a Bitcoin bounce helped steady the tape, so renewed weakness in Bitcoin or related tech stocks could undermine the current risk-on tone. On the macro side, monitor the 10-year yield around 4.06% and the dollar index near 98.85; continued mild drift lower in both would support the "up" bias, while a snapback in yields or the dollar could pressure high-duration growth sectors and curb further equity upside."]
