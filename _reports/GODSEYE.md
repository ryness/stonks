  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equity tone is risk-on with all major US indices higher on the day and week. The S&P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over 7 days, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81% and 1.08%, and small caps via the Russell 2000 are stronger at +0.78% and +4.94% over 7 days, while the Dow gains 0.48% and 2.35%. Breadth is very strong with 13 assets up versus 2 down, and the average 1-day index gain is 0.73%, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow melt-up.","Volatility and futures also confirm an improving risk appetite. The VIX fell 6.21% on the day to 14.49 and is down 21.93% over 30 days, even as equity benchmarks sit at or near record highs, signaling investors are comfortable adding risk. Equity futures mirror the cash strength with S&P futures up 0.62% on the day and 3.30% over 30 days, Nasdaq futures up 0.98% and 3.40%, and Russell futures up 0.71% and 6.70%, indicating the positive tone is expected to persist into the next session.","Rates and cross-asset signals show risk appetite is firm but not euphoric. The 10Y Treasury yield is effectively flat on the day (-0.29%) at 4.17% but has risen 4.22% over 30 days, suggesting markets are absorbing higher yields without derailing equities, consistent with the "US economic optimism" narrative behind the S&P 500's record high. At the same time, gold (+1.15% 1d, +8.74% 30d) and WTI crude (+2.35% 1d) are strong and the dollar index is modestly higher (+0.21% 1d, +0.91% 7d), showing some concurrent demand for hedges and cyclical exposure but with net risk appetite clearly improving based on equity breadth, higher small caps, and lower implied volatility."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is robust with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1-day index gain of about 0.73% across major indices shows broad, synchronized strength rather than isolated leadership. Volatility is subdued with the VIX down 6.21% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days, while the 10Y Treasury yield is stable day-on-day at 4.17% despite being higher over 30 days, indicating that rising rates have not yet disrupted risk sentiment. Taken together, these metrics point to a healthy, risk-on market environment supported by strong equity performance and contained volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Nasdaq-linked QQQ ETF is a clear positive standout with a 1-day gain of 1.00%, while the Nasdaq Composite itself is up 0.81%, highlighting growth and tech leadership. On the small-cap side, the Russell 2000 and Russell futures are also strong, up 0.78% and 0.71% respectively on the day and leading on a 7-day basis with gains of 4.94% and 4.73%, signaling a rotation into higher-beta names. On the downside, the only notable laggard in percentage terms is the Dow 30 at +0.48% for the day, making it the weakest of the major US equity benchmarks even though it is still positive, and there are no major benchmarks in this set with a negative 1-day move.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical drivers are skewed toward risk-on, centered on US economic strength and policy dynamics. The S&P 500 rally to a new record high is explicitly tied to "US economic optimism," implying that solid growth data and resilient corporate earnings are encouraging investors to look through higher nominal yields. At the same time, the recent US jobs report has led to a repricing of Federal Reserve expectations, with the dollar climbing as "Fed rate cut expectations recede," reinforcing a higher-for-longer rate backdrop that, so far, equities are digesting positively rather than treating as a risk-off shock.","Policy and geopolitical developments are also supporting selective risk-taking. The White House's call for "much more defense spending" while pressuring defense contractors to deliver more production suggests a favorable revenue backdrop for defense and related industrial names, which has recently helped energy, AI, and defense stocks drive index gains, as noted in coverage of the Dow and S&P 500 rally on sector strength. Meanwhile, broader themes like Trump's tariff policy and the coming Supreme Court ruling on tariff powers create an overhang for trade-exposed sectors, but current price action indicates investors are more focused on growth and fiscal-support narratives than on immediate trade disruption, keeping the overall tape tilted risk-on."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term triggers include the anticipated US Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariff powers, which could move trade-sensitive equities and the dollar, with a restrictive ruling likely seen as supportive for globally exposed stocks and a permissive ruling as a potential headwind. Fed-related commentary remains in focus after payrolls data "cemented" the view that the Fed will not cut soon; any fresh remarks that either reinforce or soften this stance could influence rates, the dollar, and equity multiples. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical coverage around US defense spending and energy security, as well as follow-through reporting on the strong US growth backdrop that pushed the S&P 500 to record highs, may drive sector rotation across defense, industrials, and energy, even if no single scheduled data print is highlighted in the provided context.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity strength (S&P 500 +0.65% 1d, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%), strong futures gains (Nasdaq futures +0.98%, Russell futures +0.71%), and a sharp drop in implied volatility (VIX -6.21% 1d, -21.93% over 30d). Market breadth is strong with 13 assets up versus 2 down and an average 1-day index increase of 0.73%, all while the 10Y yield is stable day-on-day and the S&P 500 has just made a record high on US economic optimism, suggesting ongoing dip-buying rather than imminent reversal. The main risk to this bias is headline sensitivity around tariffs and Fed expectations, but current price action and news framing show these are being absorbed without triggering risk-off flows, keeping the balance of probabilities skewed toward further, if incremental, upside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and S&P futures can build on their record-high levels, with S&P futures last at 7,005 and cash at 6,966.28; sustained trading above these areas would confirm the breakout and support the "up" bias, while any abrupt reversal alongside a VIX spike from 14.49 would flag profit-taking. Leadership in growth and small caps is also important: QQQ (up 1.00% on the day) and Nasdaq futures (up 0.98%) versus Russell futures (up 0.71%, +6.70% over 30 days) will indicate whether risk-on extends into higher-beta segments or narrows back to mega-cap tech.","On the macro side, focus should remain on how the 10Y yield behaves around 4.17% and on the dollar index near 99.14, as further increases in yields and the dollar without additional equity upside could signal valuation pressure. Traders should also monitor news around the prospective Supreme Court tariff ruling and ongoing commentary on Fed rate-cut expectations, since a negative surprise on tariffs or a more hawkish Fed tone could quickly challenge the current pattern of rising equities, falling VIX, and strong breadth that underpins the expected upward drift."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equity tone is risk-on with all major US indices higher on the day and week. The S&P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over 7 days, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81% and 1.08%, and small caps via the Russell 2000 are stronger at +0.78% and +4.94% over 7 days, while the Dow gains 0.48% and 2.35%. Breadth is very strong with 13 assets up versus 2 down, and the average 1-day index gain is 0.73%, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow melt-up.","Volatility and futures also confirm an improving risk appetite.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is robust with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1-day index gain of about 0.73% across major indices shows broad, synchronized strength rather than isolated leadership. Volatility is subdued with the VIX down 6.21% on the day and nearly 22% over 30 days, while the 10Y Treasury yield is stable day-on-day at 4.17% despite being higher over 30 days, indicating that rising rates have not yet disrupted risk sentiment. Taken together, these metrics point to a healthy, risk-on market environment supported by strong equity performance and contained volatility.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Nasdaq-linked QQQ ETF is a clear positive standout with a 1-day gain of 1.00%, while the Nasdaq Composite itself is up 0.81%, highlighting growth and tech leadership. On the small-cap side, the Russell 2000 and Russell futures are also strong, up 0.78% and 0.71% respectively on the day and leading on a 7-day basis with gains of 4.94% and 4.73%, signaling a rotation into higher-beta names.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity strength (S&P 500 +0.65% 1d, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%), strong futures gains (Nasdaq futures +0.98%, Russell futures +0.71%), and a sharp drop in implied volatility (VIX -6.21% 1d, -21.93% over 30d). Market breadth is strong with 13 assets up versus 2 down and an average 1-day index increase of 0.73%, all while the 10Y yield is stable day-on-day and the S&P 500 has just made a record high on US economic optimism, suggesting ongoing dip-buying rather than imminent reversal.

Leadership in growth and small caps is also important: QQQ (up 1.00% on the day) and Nasdaq futures (up 0.98%) versus Russell futures (up 0.71%, +6.70% over 30 days) will indicate whether risk-on extends into higher-beta segments or narrows back to mega-cap tech.","On the macro side, focus should remain on how the 10Y yield behaves around 4.17% and on the dollar index near 99.14, as further increases in yields and the dollar without additional equity upside could signal valuation pressure. Traders should also monitor news around the prospective Supreme Court tariff ruling and ongoing commentary on Fed rate-cut expectations, since a negative surprise on tariffs or a more hawkish Fed tone could quickly challenge the current pattern of rising equities, falling VIX, and strong breadth that underpins the expected upward drift."]

LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Equity tone is risk-on with all major US indices higher on the day and week. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over 7 days, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.81% and 1.08%, and small caps via the Russell 2000 are stronger at +0.78% and +4.94% over 7 days, while the Dow gains 0.48% and 2.35%.
