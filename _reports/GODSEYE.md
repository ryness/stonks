  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities finished mixed with a slightly negative tilt as the average index change was -0.05% on the day, led lower by the Dow 30 (-0.65%) while the Nasdaq Composite (+0.13%) and Russell 2000 (+0.22%) outperformed; breadth showed 9 up vs 6 down across tracked benchmarks. Risk appetite is tentative but stabilizing at the margin given the S&P 500 slipped just -0.05% and SPY -0.02% while tech proxies like QQQ gained +0.08%.
  
  Volatility cooled modestly with VIX at 19.83 (-0.85% 1d), though it remains elevated on a trend basis with +10.11% over 7d and +19.10% over 30d, signaling lingering caution. Futures lean risk-on overnight with Nasdaq +0.71%, S&P +0.46%, Russell +0.25%, and Dow +0.10%, suggesting a bid to stabilize after last week’s weakness.
  
  Rates are a mild headwind with the 10Y Treasury yield up +0.88% on the day to 4.15 (7d -0.22%), while the US Dollar edged +0.12% and crude fell -1.03%, a cross-asset mix that does not signal acute stress. On a 7d view, risk appetite has faded as the Nasdaq (-2.55%) and Russell (-3.11%) lag, but the green futures and softer VIX day-over-day point to a near-term improvement attempt.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral to slightly fragile. The average index change was -0.05% with breadth modestly positive at 9 up and 6 down, pointing to stabilization rather than strength. VIX at 19.83 is down -0.85% on the day but up +10.11% over 7d, keeping the tape cautious. The 10Y yield at 4.15 rose +0.88% on the day, which tempers risk appetite despite firmer futures.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, small caps led with the Russell 2000 up +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite gained +0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 (-3.11%) and Nasdaq Composite (-2.55%) are notable laggards, while the Dow 30 (-0.35%) has held up best among major US indices.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve path and a “data fog” from the recent US government shutdown are pressuring sentiment, with several reports highlighting doubts about near-term rate cuts and messy data calendars. This aligns with last week’s risk-off tone and higher risk premia, reflected in a 7d VIX rise of +10.11% and equity weakness, particularly in growth and small caps. AI and mega-cap tech valuation concerns remain in focus, with investors turning to Nvidia’s upcoming results for direction, as noted in multiple previews flagging heightened tech volatility. The modest tech outperformance on the day (QQQ +0.08%, Nasdaq +0.13%) and stronger Nasdaq futures (+0.71%) suggest positioning for stabilization, but the outcome is a key swing factor for broader risk sentiment. Recent headlines also pointed to futures pressure tied to valuation concerns and fading hopes for imminent Fed cuts, which contributed to last week’s selloff. The current rebound in S&P (+0.46%) and Nasdaq (+0.71%) futures indicates some easing of those fears in the near term, but elevated VIX and higher 10Y yields keep the backdrop cautious rather than unequivocally risk-on.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% - Equity futures are broadly higher (S&P +0.46%, Nasdaq +0.71%, Russell +0.25%, Dow +0.10%), breadth was 9/6 positive, and VIX eased -0.85% on the day, outweighing last week’s drawdown and a +0.88% 10Y yield uptick; the setup favors a modest bounce over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures levels for confirmation of follow-through: ES around 6,786 versus S&P 500 cash at 6,734, NQ near 25,272, and RTY near 2,402 against Russell 2000 cash at 2,388. Tech leadership is pivotal ahead of Nvidia-related headlines; continued strength in QQQ and the Nasdaq versus cyclicals would support the risk-on bias, while renewed Dow underperformance could flag rotation risk. Monitor macro gauges that can blunt the bounce: VIX holding below 20 (last 19.83) would help, while a push higher would undermine risk. The 10Y yield at 4.15 and the US Dollar at 99.39 are key—softening yields and a steady dollar would be supportive, whereas a rate pop alongside risk-averse moves in gold or oil (WTI last 59.47 near the 60 handle) could cap upside.
