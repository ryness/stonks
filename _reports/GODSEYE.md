  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is fading. Equities were broadly lower with the S&P 500 down 0.83%, Dow 30 off 1.07%, and Nasdaq Composite down 1.22%, while only the Russell 2000 eked out a 0.31% gain. Breadth was weak (4 up, 11 down) and the average 1-day index change was -0.81%, signaling defensive positioning.
  
  Volatility is rising meaningfully: VIX jumped 10.32% on the day to 24.69 and is up 29.40% over 7 days and 43.21% over 30 days. Futures point to a softer tone overnight with S&P -0.17%, Nasdaq -0.28%, Dow -0.12%, and Russell -0.19%, reinforcing the risk-off bias.
  
  Rates and FX are not providing relief: the 10Y Treasury yield was little changed on the day (-0.24% to 4.12%) but is modestly higher over 7 days (+0.73%). The US Dollar was flat (+0.03%). Gold firmed (+0.43%) while WTI slipped (-0.33%), consistent with a cautious, de-risking backdrop.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak. Breadth skewed negative (4 up vs 11 down) and the average 1-day change across benchmarks was -0.81%, confirming broad selling pressure. Elevated volatility (VIX 24.69, +10.32% on the day and +29.40% over 7 days) contrasts with only marginal day-over-day relief in the 10Y Treasury yield (4.12%, -0.24%), suggesting equity stress is not primarily rate-driven. Overall conditions tilt risk-off.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership flipped defensively: on the day, small caps led with the Russell 2000 up 0.31%, while mega-cap tech lagged as the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.22% (QQQ -1.22%). Over the past week, small caps and growth underperformed the most (Russell 2000 -3.46%, Nasdaq Composite -2.49%), while the S&P 500 (-1.66%) declined less than peers.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Event risk around AI and macro data is driving caution. Multiple headlines flagged stocks being pressured ahead of Nvidia earnings and upcoming US economic data, which aligns with tech-led weakness (QQQ -1.22%, Nasdaq -1.22%) and higher VIX (+10.32%). This skews risk-off until results and data clarify the earnings and demand outlook. Cross-asset jitters from crypto added to the risk backdrop. Coverage noted bitcoin’s sell-off and subsequent stabilization attempts; this coincided with broader equity weakness and elevated volatility, reinforcing de-risking behavior and keeping the tape fragile. Hawkish Federal Reserve commentary and recent uneven jobs/inflation prints have undermined rate-cut hopes, contributing to volatility. Reports highlighted tougher Fed signaling and data uncertainty, which maps to a 7-day rise in the 10Y yield (+0.73%) and a 29.40% 7-day spike in VIX, sustaining a risk-off tone.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings and US jobs data in the next 24 hours are the key catalysts; a strong print and outlook could stabilize tech and compress VIX, while disappointment risks extending the selloff and keeping volatility elevated.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% — Broad equity weakness (S&P -0.83%, Nasdaq -1.22%) alongside poor breadth (4 up/11 down) and a sharp VIX rise to 24.69 (+10.32%) point to persistent risk-off. Overnight futures are modestly lower (ES -0.17%, NQ -0.28%), and event risk from Nvidia earnings and jobs data argues for continued caution near term.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Monitor index futures for follow-through: S&P 500 futures near 6,628.5 and Nasdaq futures around 24,526.25 alongside VIX at 24.69. If VIX holds in the mid-20s or rises, dips in ES/NQ are less likely to be bought; a decisive VIX pullback would be an early sign of stabilization. Watch relative moves in tech vs small caps: QQQ at 596.31 vs Russell futures at 2,351.30. Continued tech underperformance would pressure the broader tape, while any sustained Russell outperformance could signal rotation rather than outright de-risking. Focus on the macro tape bombs: Nvidia’s results and guidance and the US jobs data. Stronger-than-feared prints could lift QQQ and ease VIX, whereas a miss or soft labor signal that stokes policy uncertainty would likely extend the drawdown and keep volatility bid.
