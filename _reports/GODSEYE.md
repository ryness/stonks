  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities closed mixed with a slight negative tilt: the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.22%. Breadth was nearly even at 7 up vs 8 down and the average index change was -0.05%, signaling only marginal risk-taking on the day. Over the past week, risk appetite has faded more clearly, with the S&P 500 down 0.91%, the Nasdaq off 2.55%, and the Russell down 3.11%.
  
  Volatility eased intraday but remains elevated, with the VIX at 19.83 down 0.85% on the day yet up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over 30 days. This profile suggests the market is stabilizing tactically but still pricing a higher risk premium than a month ago, tempering risk appetite.
  
  Futures echoed the mixed tone: S&P futures -0.07%, Nasdaq futures essentially flat, Dow futures -0.67%, and Russell futures +0.25%. Rates leaned tighter as the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, a backdrop that tends to cap equity upside. Taken together, risk appetite is tentative on the day but has deteriorated over the week, as seen in negative weekly futures and index performance.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious-neutral. Breadth was narrowly negative at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners and the average index change was -0.05%, reflecting a modest risk-off skew. Volatility remains elevated with the VIX at 19.83 and up 10.11% over the week, while the 10Y Treasury yield ticked up 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, both of which restrain risk-taking. Against this backdrop, today’s slight stabilization in growth indices does not offset the broader weekly softening.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, small caps and tech have been the notable underperformers, with the Russell 2000 down 3.11% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.55%, whereas the Dow 30 held up best at -0.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment has been pressured by a tech-led sell-off and concerns over the Chinese economy, as highlighted by headlines noting global markets struggling after a slump in investment in China. This aligns with the Nasdaq’s 7-day decline of 2.55% and the VIX’s 10.11% weekly rise, reinforcing a risk-off tone tied to growth and China-sensitive demand fears. Trade policy developments offered a modest offset, with Australia welcoming the removal of U.S. tariffs on beef and other food imports. Reduced trade frictions can be risk-on for agriculture and consumer supply chains at the margin, complementing a softer U.S. dollar over the week (-0.93%), though the impact has not reversed broader equity weakness. The rates backdrop is also a macro driver: the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, which typically tightens financial conditions and weighs on equity multiples. This rate move likely contributed to the mixed equity close and underperformance of the Dow even as select growth pockets firmed.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — Mixed signals prevail with the S&P 500 -0.05% and Dow -0.65% offset by the Nasdaq +0.13% and Russell 2000 +0.22%, while breadth was 7 up vs 8 down and the VIX eased 0.85% on the day but remains elevated on a 7-day basis (+10.11%). Futures are similarly split (ES -0.07%, NQ ~0%, YM -0.67%, RTY +0.25%) and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%, leaving a balance of modest positives and negatives into the next session.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch the volatility and rates pivots: VIX near the 20 handle (last 19.83) and the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15%. Sustained VIX below 20 alongside a steadier 10Y could support stability consistent with a flat bias, while a push back above 20 or a further rise in yields would tilt risk lower. Track index and futures leadership for confirmation of tone: S&P futures around 6,755 (-0.07% 1d), Nasdaq futures near 25,094 (~flat 1d), Dow futures 47,229 (-0.67% 1d), and Russell futures 2,396 (+0.25% 1d). If the Russell 2000 (cash 2,388.23) and Nasdaq sustain relative strength while the Dow lags, the session likely remains range-bound; a reversal in small caps or tech would raise downside risk. Monitor cross-asset signals: WTI crude at 60.09 (+2.39% 1d) and gold at 4,087.60 (-2.37% 1d), alongside the U.S. dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d, -0.93% 7d). An oil-led rise alongside firmer yields could cap equities, while a softer dollar and steadier gold could coincide with calmer risk conditions.

## 1. Pulse

Equities closed mixed with a slight negative tilt: the S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.22%. Breadth was nearly even at 7 up vs 8 down and the average index change was -0.05%, signaling only marginal risk-taking on the day. Over the past week, risk appetite has faded more clearly, with the S&P 500 down 0.91%, the Nasdaq off 2.55%, and the Russell down 3.11%.

Volatility eased intraday but remains elevated, with the VIX at 19.83 down 0.85% on the day yet up 10.11% over the week and 19.10% over 30 days. This profile suggests the market is stabilizing tactically but still pricing a higher risk premium than a month ago, tempering risk appetite.

Futures echoed the mixed tone: S&P futures -0.07%, Nasdaq futures essentially flat, Dow futures -0.67%, and Russell futures +0.25%. Rates leaned tighter as the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, a backdrop that tends to cap equity upside. Taken together, risk appetite is tentative on the day but has deteriorated over the week, as seen in negative weekly futures and index performance.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious-neutral. Breadth was narrowly negative at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners and the average index change was -0.05%, reflecting a modest risk-off skew. Volatility remains elevated with the VIX at 19.83 and up 10.11% over the week, while the 10Y Treasury yield ticked up 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, both of which restrain risk-taking. Against this backdrop, today’s slight stabilization in growth indices does not offset the broader weekly softening.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated toward growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, small caps and tech have been the notable underperformers, with the Russell 2000 down 3.11% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.55%, whereas the Dow 30 held up best at -0.35%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment has been pressured by a tech-led sell-off and concerns over the Chinese economy, as highlighted by headlines noting global markets struggling after a slump in investment in China. This aligns with the Nasdaq’s 7-day decline of 2.55% and the VIX’s 10.11% weekly rise, reinforcing a risk-off tone tied to growth and China-sensitive demand fears. Trade policy developments offered a modest offset, with Australia welcoming the removal of U.S. tariffs on beef and other food imports. Reduced trade frictions can be risk-on for agriculture and consumer supply chains at the margin, complementing a softer U.S. dollar over the week (-0.93%), though the impact has not reversed broader equity weakness. The rates backdrop is also a macro driver: the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, which typically tightens financial conditions and weighs on equity multiples. This rate move likely contributed to the mixed equity close and underperformance of the Dow even as select growth pockets firmed.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — Mixed signals prevail with the S&P 500 -0.05% and Dow -0.65% offset by the Nasdaq +0.13% and Russell 2000 +0.22%, while breadth was 7 up vs 8 down and the VIX eased 0.85% on the day but remains elevated on a 7-day basis (+10.11%). Futures are similarly split (ES -0.07%, NQ ~0%, YM -0.67%, RTY +0.25%) and the 10Y yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%, leaving a balance of modest positives and negatives into the next session.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch the volatility and rates pivots: VIX near the 20 handle (last 19.83) and the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15%. Sustained VIX below 20 alongside a steadier 10Y could support stability consistent with a flat bias, while a push back above 20 or a further rise in yields would tilt risk lower. Track index and futures leadership for confirmation of tone: S&P futures around 6,755 (-0.07% 1d), Nasdaq futures near 25,094 (~flat 1d), Dow futures 47,229 (-0.67% 1d), and Russell futures 2,396 (+0.25% 1d). If the Russell 2000 (cash 2,388.23) and Nasdaq sustain relative strength while the Dow lags, the session likely remains range-bound; a reversal in small caps or tech would raise downside risk. Monitor cross-asset signals: WTI crude at 60.09 (+2.39% 1d) and gold at 4,087.60 (-2.37% 1d), alongside the U.S. dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d, -0.93% 7d). An oil-led rise alongside firmer yields could cap equities, while a softer dollar and steadier gold could coincide with calmer risk conditions.
