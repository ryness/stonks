  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are in a constructive, risk-on phase with broad gains and tech leadership. The S&P 500 is up 0.81% on the day and 1.61% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +1.26% 1d and +2.69% 7d, despite still being down 2.45% over 30d. Breadth is positive with 13 up vs 2 down assets, and QQQ's 1.45% daily rise underscores renewed appetite for growth and AI-related names after the recent selloff tied to disruption fears.","Volatility signals improving risk sentiment as the VIX dropped 8.29% on the day and 12.96% over the week to 17.93, even though it remains about 18.6% above its 30-day level, reflecting that the market is coming off a higher-stress regime. Equity futures confirm the constructive tone, with S&P futures up 0.67% and Nasdaq futures up 1.12% on the day and both higher over the week, indicating follow-through buying interest beyond the cash session.","Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive rather than restrictive. The 10-year Treasury yield is little changed on the day (+0.37%) and slightly lower over 7 and 30 days (-0.20% and -3.32%), suggesting modest easing in rate pressure. At the same time, classic hedges like gold (+1.01% 1d, +13.11% 30d) and crude (+4.45% 7d, +10.40% 30d) remain firm, indicating that while risk appetite is clearly improving in equities, there is still an undercurrent of macro and geopolitical caution being expressed in commodities."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the near term. Breadth is strong, with 13 of 15 tracked assets higher and only 2 lower, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.90% reflects a broad-based advance across major benchmarks. The sharp drop in VIX over the last day and week, paired with a slightly lower 10-year yield over 7 and 30 days, points to easing stress rather than a rates-driven headwind. Overall, the market appears to be in a healthy rebound phase after recent volatility, with conditions tilted toward risk-taking but not yet euphoric.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is clearly in growth and tech, with the Nasdaq Composite up 1.26% on the day and QQQ up 1.45%, making them standout gainers versus more modest moves in the Dow (+0.63%) and Russell 2000 (+0.41%). On a 7-day view, the Nasdaq Composite (+2.69%) and QQQ (+2.45%) also lead, outpacing the S&P 500's +1.61%. Laggards include the Dow, which is barely negative over the week (-0.04% 7d) and down 0.22% over 30 days despite its +0.63% daily pop, as well as the Dow futures complex (-0.22% 7d) that trails other index futures. This pattern underscores a rotation back toward higher-beta tech and away from more defensive blue-chip exposure.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The primary macro theme driving the tape is the swing in sentiment around artificial intelligence and tech disruption. Recent reports noted that Wall Street previously sold off on AI-disruption fears, but the latest session saw a rebound as investors "bought the dip" in tech and AI-linked names, easing those concerns. This shift has supported a risk-on tone, particularly in growth benchmarks like the Nasdaq and QQQ, and aligns with the outsized 1-day gains there versus other indices.","Trade and tariff uncertainty is another key macro overlay influencing risk appetite. Recent news highlighted sharp market declines tied to renewed tariff threats and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down Trump-era tariffs, with prior selloffs in U.S. and global markets linked to those trade worries. While today's price action is positive, the backdrop of shifting trade policy remains a potential risk-off catalyst that helps explain why hedges like gold (+3.70% 7d, +13.11% 30d) and crude (+4.45% 7d, +10.40% 30d) have stayed elevated.","Broader macro data and recession concerns in the U.S. also feature in the narrative. Articles referencing a Bloomberg analyst warning of Bitcoin downside on U.S. recession risks, as well as discussions of softer GDP growth and jobs revisions, show that growth anxiety is still present even as equities rally. This tension between improving near-term risk appetite in stocks and persistent macro caution in crypto and safe-haven flows creates a mixed but currently risk-on skew in cross-asset behavior."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers within the next 24 hours that could move markets include Nvidia's earnings, which news indicates investors are closely watching after an AI-driven tech rebound and prior AI-disruption fears; this report could significantly influence Nasdaq and QQQ direction. U.S. macro data such as GDP and inflation (PCE) updates are also in focus per recent futures commentary and could affect rate expectations and equity multiples. Additionally, political events like President Trump's State of the Union address are highlighted in futures coverage and could drive volatility around tariffs, fiscal policy, and broader risk sentiment.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is up, given broad-based equity gains (average 1d index move ~+0.90%), strong tech leadership (Nasdaq Composite +1.26%, QQQ +1.45%), and confirming strength in futures (S&P +0.67%, Nasdaq +1.12% on the day). The VIX has dropped sharply over 1 and 7 days, indicating easing fear and supportive risk appetite, while the 10-year yield is stable to slightly lower over a month, reducing rate pressure. With the tape rebounding from prior AI and tariff-driven selloffs and key catalysts like Nvidia's earnings and U.S. data in focus, the path of least resistance appears modestly higher, albeit with event risk that tempers confidence from being higher than mid-60s.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch tech and AI bellwethers closely into the next session, as they are driving leadership: QQQ is up 1.45% and Nasdaq futures are up 1.12% on the day, so continued strength there is key to sustaining an "up" bias. Monitoring whether the Nasdaq Composite can build on its 2.69% 7-day gain despite still being down 2.45% over 30 days will help gauge if this is a durable rotation back into growth or just a short-covering rally.","On the macro side, focus on S&P 500 futures around the 6,950 area and whether they can hold or extend the current 0.67% daily and 1.46% weekly advances into and through upcoming events like Nvidia earnings and U.S. GDP/PCE data. Also track VIX behavior around the high-teens level (17.93), as a continued grind lower would validate the risk-on move, while a snap-back higher alongside rising 10-year yields from roughly 4.05% could signal that macro or policy headlines are shifting sentiment back toward risk-off."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equities are in a constructive, risk-on phase with broad gains and tech leadership. The S&P 500 is up 0.81% on the day and 1.61% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +1.26% 1d and +2.69% 7d, despite still being down 2.45% over 30d. Breadth is positive with 13 up vs 2 down assets, and QQQ's 1.45% daily rise underscores renewed appetite for growth and AI-related names after the recent selloff tied to disruption fears.","Volatility signals improving risk sentiment as the VIX dropped 8.29% on the day and 12.96% over the week to 17.93, even though it remains about 18.6% above its 30-day level, reflecting that the market is coming off a higher-stress regime. Equity futures confirm the constructive tone, with S&P futures up 0.67% and Nasdaq futures up 1.12% on the day and both higher over the week, indicating follow-through buying interest beyond the cash session.","Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive rather than restrictive. The 10-year Treasury yield is little changed on the day (+0.37%) and slightly lower over 7 and 30 days (-0.20% and -3.32%), suggesting modest easing in rate pressure. At the same time, classic hedges like gold (+1.01% 1d, +13.11% 30d) and crude (+4.45% 7d, +10.40% 30d) remain firm, indicating that while risk appetite is clearly improving in equities, there is still an undercurrent of macro and geopolitical caution being expressed in commodities."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the near term. Breadth is strong, with 13 of 15 tracked assets higher and only 2 lower, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.90% reflects a broad-based advance across major benchmarks. The sharp drop in VIX over the last day and week, paired with a slightly lower 10-year yield over 7 and 30 days, points to easing stress rather than a rates-driven headwind. Overall, the market appears to be in a healthy rebound phase after recent volatility, with conditions tilted toward risk-taking but not yet euphoric.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is clearly in growth and tech, with the Nasdaq Composite up 1.26% on the day and QQQ up 1.45%, making them standout gainers versus more modest moves in the Dow (+0.63%) and Russell 2000 (+0.41%). On a 7-day view, the Nasdaq Composite (+2.69%) and QQQ (+2.45%) also lead, outpacing the S&P 500's +1.61%. Laggards include the Dow, which is barely negative over the week (-0.04% 7d) and down 0.22% over 30 days despite its +0.63% daily pop, as well as the Dow futures complex (-0.22% 7d) that trails other index futures. This pattern underscores a rotation back toward higher-beta tech and away from more defensive blue-chip exposure.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The primary macro theme driving the tape is the swing in sentiment around artificial intelligence and tech disruption. Recent reports noted that Wall Street previously sold off on AI-disruption fears, but the latest session saw a rebound as investors "bought the dip" in tech and AI-linked names, easing those concerns. This shift has supported a risk-on tone, particularly in growth benchmarks like the Nasdaq and QQQ, and aligns with the outsized 1-day gains there versus other indices.","Trade and tariff uncertainty is another key macro overlay influencing risk appetite. Recent news highlighted sharp market declines tied to renewed tariff threats and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down Trump-era tariffs, with prior selloffs in U.S. and global markets linked to those trade worries. While today's price action is positive, the backdrop of shifting trade policy remains a potential risk-off catalyst that helps explain why hedges like gold (+3.70% 7d, +13.11% 30d) and crude (+4.45% 7d, +10.40% 30d) have stayed elevated.","Broader macro data and recession concerns in the U.S. also feature in the narrative. Articles referencing a Bloomberg analyst warning of Bitcoin downside on U.S. recession risks, as well as discussions of softer GDP growth and jobs revisions, show that growth anxiety is still present even as equities rally. This tension between improving near-term risk appetite in stocks and persistent macro caution in crypto and safe-haven flows creates a mixed but currently risk-on skew in cross-asset behavior."]

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers within the next 24 hours that could move markets include Nvidia's earnings, which news indicates investors are closely watching after an AI-driven tech rebound and prior AI-disruption fears; this report could significantly influence Nasdaq and QQQ direction. U.S. macro data such as GDP and inflation (PCE) updates are also in focus per recent futures commentary and could affect rate expectations and equity multiples. Additionally, political events like President Trump's State of the Union address are highlighted in futures coverage and could drive volatility around tariffs, fiscal policy, and broader risk sentiment.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is up, given broad-based equity gains (average 1d index move ~+0.90%), strong tech leadership (Nasdaq Composite +1.26%, QQQ +1.45%), and confirming strength in futures (S&P +0.67%, Nasdaq +1.12% on the day). The VIX has dropped sharply over 1 and 7 days, indicating easing fear and supportive risk appetite, while the 10-year yield is stable to slightly lower over a month, reducing rate pressure. With the tape rebounding from prior AI and tariff-driven selloffs and key catalysts like Nvidia's earnings and U.S. data in focus, the path of least resistance appears modestly higher, albeit with event risk that tempers confidence from being higher than mid-60s.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch tech and AI bellwethers closely into the next session, as they are driving leadership: QQQ is up 1.45% and Nasdaq futures are up 1.12% on the day, so continued strength there is key to sustaining an "up" bias. Monitoring whether the Nasdaq Composite can build on its 2.69% 7-day gain despite still being down 2.45% over 30 days will help gauge if this is a durable rotation back into growth or just a short-covering rally.","On the macro side, focus on S&P 500 futures around the 6,950 area and whether they can hold or extend the current 0.67% daily and 1.46% weekly advances into and through upcoming events like Nvidia earnings and U.S. GDP/PCE data. Also track VIX behavior around the high-teens level (17.93), as a continued grind lower would validate the risk-on move, while a snap-back higher alongside rising 10-year yields from roughly 4.05% could signal that macro or policy headlines are shifting sentiment back toward risk-off."]
