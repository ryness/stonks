  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equity tone is constructive with a clear risk-on skew in cash markets. The S&P 500 gained 0.67%, the Dow 1.06%, the Nasdaq 0.33%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.32% rise, while average index performance is up about 0.74% on the day and 8 of 15 tracked assets are higher. Over the past week, all major U.S. equity benchmarks are up 1.1%–3.7%, indicating improving risk appetite despite modest 30-day softness in the Nasdaq (-0.73%) and QQQ (-0.84%).","Volatility and futures paint a more cautious near-term picture. The VIX is modestly higher on the day (+2.28%) at 16.13 but remains lower over 7 and 30 days (-2.77% and -4.67%), suggesting hedging demand is ticking up ahead of event risk but not signaling outright stress. S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are all slightly negative on the day (-0.52%, -0.72%, and -0.16%, respectively), implying some near-term risk-off positioning into the next session even as the Russell futures hold essentially flat (-0.02%) and remain strongly higher over the week (+3.80%).","Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed but broadly consistent with a cautious risk-on environment. The 10Y Treasury yield is down 0.53% on the day to 4.16% but still higher over 7 and 30 days (+1.66% and +4.54%), pointing to a modest back-up in yields over the month that has not yet derailed equities. Gold futures are strong (+1.25% 1d, +6.65% 30d), while crude is weak (-1.47% 1d, -4.76% 30d) and the dollar is softer across all horizons, a combination that reflects both demand for hedges and expectations of easier Fed policy, but overall risk appetite is still improving more than fading based on broad equity gains and subdued volatility levels."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks reasonably solid, with 8 of 15 tracked assets advancing and the average index change around +0.74% on the day. Broad U.S. benchmarks are all green, led by cyclically sensitive small caps, which supports the idea of improving internal breadth. The VIX at 16.13 is low in an absolute sense despite a 2.28% daily uptick, and the 10Y yield dipping 0.53% on the day provides a modest tailwind versus the higher-yield backdrop of the past month. Taken together, the tape looks healthy but not euphoric, with some event-related caution reflected in futures and volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership has rotated toward cyclicals and smaller caps, with the Russell 2000 the standout gainer at +1.32% on the day and Russell futures also leading over the week (+3.80%). Among large caps, the Dow is outperforming with a 1.06% daily gain, while the S&P 500 is up 0.67% and the Nasdaq lags at +0.33% as QQQ adds only 0.41%. On the downside, WTI crude is a clear laggard with a -1.47% daily move, and Nasdaq futures are the weakest of the major equity futures at -0.72% on the day, underscoring relative pressure on growth and tech versus value and small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The dominant macro theme driving the tape is the looming Federal Reserve decision, with markets heavily pricing a rate cut but uncertain about the guidance path. Headlines note U.S. stock futures and global shares are on "tenterhooks" ahead of a divided Fed board, with an 85%–90% implied chance of a 25 bps cut and investors focused on Powell's commentary. This creates a push-pull dynamic: expectations of easier policy support a medium-term risk-on bias in equities and precious metals, but near-term positioning is cautious, as seen in softer S&P and Nasdaq futures and a 2.28% uptick in VIX.","Another important theme is the surge in precious metals and the broader speculative tone around them. News highlights silver breaking records above $61/oz and hitting all-time highs, while gold futures in the data are up 1.25% on the day and 6.65% over 30 days, signaling strong demand for hedges and real-asset exposure. This metals strength, alongside a weaker dollar across all time frames, is consistent with markets positioning for lower real rates and more accommodative Fed policy, which supports risk-on behavior in equities but also reflects underlying concern about policy credibility and longer-term inflation, adding a defensive layer to the current rally."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key triggers over the next 24 hours center on the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy decision and related communication, with the rate announcement scheduled and Powell's press conference to follow; markets have priced roughly an 85%–90% chance of a 25 bps cut, so any deviation in the size of the cut or in guidance on 2026 easing could produce outsized equity and rate volatility. In addition, global investors are watching upcoming China inflation data mentioned in Asia-Pacific previews, which could sway risk sentiment and commodities if it surprises significantly. Earnings commentary in the AI and semiconductor space is also flagged in headlines as a potential test for high valuations, meaning guidance from key AI-linked companies could drive relative moves in growth versus value and in Nasdaq-linked benchmarks.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% While cash equities show a constructive tone with broad gains, futures are modestly negative (S&P -0.52%, Nasdaq -0.72%, Dow -0.16%, Russell -0.02%) and the VIX is up 2.28% ahead of the Fed decision, indicating event risk is tempering directional conviction. The combination of a heavily anticipated rate cut, low but rising short-term volatility, and mixed cross-asset signals (strong gold, weak oil, softer dollar) suggests the most likely outcome over the next 24 hours is a choppy, range-bound tape rather than a decisive trend. A clearly dovish or hawkish surprise could break this equilibrium, but based on current pricing and positioning, a net flat outcome with intraday swings is the highest-probability path.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should closely monitor how S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures trade around current levels near 6,856 for ES and 25,612 for NQ, especially in the immediate aftermath of the Fed announcement and Powell's remarks. Attention to the VIX around 16 is critical; a sustained break higher would signal a shift from contained event risk to a broader volatility regime change, while a post-Fed fade in VIX would validate continued risk-on appetite. Watching whether the Russell futures can hold their recent leadership near 2,563.5 will also help gauge if the small-cap outperformance trend remains intact.","Macro-wise, the U.S. 10Y yield around 4.16% is a key pivot: a sharp move lower on dovish guidance would likely support duration-sensitive growth and tech, while a surprise back-up in yields could pressure Nasdaq-linked instruments already lagging on a 30-day basis. Sector-wise, traders should watch AI and high-valuation tech names highlighted in earnings-related commentary, as any disappointment could reinforce the relative strength seen in Dow and Russell benchmarks over QQQ and the Nasdaq. In commodities and FX, follow-through in gold above roughly 4,248.8 and continued dollar softness would confirm the market's easing-policy narrative, whereas a reversal in either could signal a reassessment of the Fed path and alter the equity bias quickly."]

["Equity tone is constructive with a clear risk-on skew in cash markets. The S&P 500 gained 0.67%, the Dow 1.06%, the Nasdaq 0.33%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.32% rise, while average index performance is up about 0.74% on the day and 8 of 15 tracked assets are higher.

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% While cash equities show a constructive tone with broad gains, futures are modestly negative (S&P -0.52%, Nasdaq -0.72%, Dow -0.16%, Russell -0.02%) and the VIX is up 2.28% ahead of the Fed decision, indicating event risk is tempering directional conviction.

LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Equity tone is constructive with a clear risk-on skew in cash markets. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.67%, the Dow 1.06%, the Nasdaq 0.33%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.32% rise, while average index performance is up about 0.74% on the day and 8 of 15 tracked assets are higher. Over the past week, all major U.S. equity benchmarks are up 1.1%–3.7%, indicating improving risk appetite despite modest 30-day softness in the Nasdaq (-0.73%) and QQQ (-0.84%).&quot;,&quot;Volatility and futures paint a more cautious near-term picture. The VIX is modestly higher on the day (+2.28%) at 16.1
