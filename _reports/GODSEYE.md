  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across assets, the tone has shifted cautiously risk-off. Major US equity indices were marginally lower on the last cash session (S&P 500 -0.06%, Dow -0.17%, Nasdaq -0.06%), with only the Russell 2000 eking out a gain (+0.12%). Under the surface, however, risk appetite has been stronger over the past month, with the Russell 2000 up 6.6% and the Dow up 3.1%, indicating that the latest pullback is modest relative to recent gains.
  
  Volatility and futures are signalling a sharper deterioration in sentiment than the spot indices alone. The VIX has spiked 28.6% in 1d and 32.0% over 7d to 20.4, while S&P, Nasdaq, Dow and Russell futures are all down between roughly 1.5% and 2.0% on the day, with Nasdaq futures the weakest at -2.0% 1d and -2.0% 7d. This combination of rising implied volatility and sizable overnight futures declines points to fading risk appetite near term despite the mild cash index moves.
  
  Rates and defensives corroborate the risk-off tilt. The 10Y Treasury yield is grinding higher (up 1.7% 1d and 4.3% over 30d to 4.23%), which tightens financial conditions, while gold has surged 3.3% on the day and 12.5% over 30d, a classic safety bid. The US dollar is down 0.8% on the day and modestly softer over 7–30 days, but the dominant signal is the combination of higher yields, higher volatility, and stronger haven demand, all consistent with a cooling of risk appetite from previously constructive levels.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is currently fragile. Breadth is negative, with 11 instruments down versus only 4 up and an average 1d index change of about -0.06%, showing modest but broad-based pressure. The sharp 28.6% 1d jump in the VIX to 20.4 alongside a 1.7% rise in the 10Y yield to 4.23% signals tightening conditions and rising risk aversion. Taken together, modest headline index declines mask a deterioration in underlying risk metrics, leaving the tape looking more cautious than the surface would suggest.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership has rotated toward small caps and value over the last week, with the Russell 2000 up 3.97% 7d and 0.12% 1d, and the Dow up 0.74% 7d and 3.08% over 30d. In contrast, large-cap growth and tech proxies are lagging, as the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.29% over 7d and the QQQ ETF is down 0.44% 7d and 0.23% over 30d, with both QQQ and SPY off 0.08% on the day. On the futures side, Nasdaq futures are the notable underperformer with a -2.01% 1d move, while Russell futures, despite being -2.00% 1d, still show a stronger 30d profile (+4.02%) than S&P and Nasdaq futures.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro sentiment is being buoyed at a high level by the IMF's upgraded outlook for the global economy, which now projects 3.3% growth this year, underpinned in part by strong AI-related investment across North America and Asia. This kind of growth forecast typically supports a risk-on backdrop and helps explain why US indices are still modestly higher over 7–30 days despite today's wobble, with the S&P 500 up 0.28% 7d and 1.32% over 30d and the Dow up 3.08% over 30d. At the same time, geopolitics and trade frictions are acting as clear risk-off catalysts. President Trump's announcement of escalating tariffs on eight European nations has already triggered significant stress in crypto markets, with $875 million in liquidations cited, and global coverage highlights renewed trade-tension concerns. The sharp 28.6% 1d spike in VIX, broad risk-off moves in US equity futures (S&P -1.66%, Nasdaq -2.01%, Dow -1.55%, Russell -2.00%), and the concurrent bid in gold (+3.28% 1d) are consistent with markets pricing in higher uncertainty and potential growth or earnings headwinds from these tariff measures. Regional equity flows and earnings headlines provide additional nuance but do not offset the broader caution. Indian equities, for example, saw a boost from upbeat Infosys earnings and AI-driven optimism, but coverage notes that broader sentiment remains cautious amid foreign outflows and geopolitical worries. Combined with articles highlighting elevated volatility across asset classes and scrutiny of AI-driven equity leadership, these developments reinforce a mixed but currently tilting risk-off tone, where positive macro data is being overshadowed in the very short term by trade shocks and higher rates.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete market-moving events over the next 24 hours are not specified in the provided data, so specific earnings, economic releases, or policy decisions cannot be identified; upcoming triggers are therefore unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 65% confidence. The call for a near-term downside bias is grounded in the sharp deterioration in risk metrics: VIX is up 28.6% on the day to 20.4, and all major US equity futures are materially lower (S&P -1.66%, Nasdaq -2.01%, Dow -1.55%, Russell -2.00%) even as the last cash session showed only marginal index declines. Rising 10Y Treasury yields (+1.7% 1d to 4.23%) and a strong bid into gold (+3.28% 1d) further confirm a shift to risk-off positioning, likely keeping pressure on equities over the next 24 hours barring unspecified positive surprises.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should focus on how cash indices react to the futures-led drawdown and elevated volatility. On the S&P complex, the contrast between the modest -0.06% cash move and the -1.66% decline in S&P futures suggests a potential gap-down open; monitoring whether spot can stabilize around recent 1-month gains of roughly +1.3% or accelerates lower will be key to gauging if this is a shallow pullback or the start of a deeper correction. Nasdaq futures' -2.01% drop and QQQ's soft 7–30 day profile make large-cap tech a focal point for downside follow-through. Sector and style leadership should also be watched closely, particularly the divergence between small caps and megacap growth. The Russell 2000's stronger 7–30 day performance (+3.97% and +6.59%) versus the Nasdaq and QQQ may come under pressure if the -2.00% hit in Russell futures persists, so traders should track whether small caps continue to outperform on a relative basis or finally roll over. In parallel, the ongoing climb in the 10Y yield to 4.23% and the spike in VIX to 20.4 should be monitored as barometers of stress; if yields and volatility remain elevated or push higher, it would support the expected downward bias in equities over the next session. From a macro and cross-asset standpoint, gold and the US dollar provide important confirmation signals for risk sentiment. Gold's strong upside momentum (+3.28% 1d and +12.51% 30d) indicates persistent demand for safety, and any further extension higher while equities and futures remain weak would reinforce the risk-off narrative. Conversely, watch whether the US dollar, currently down 0.84% on the day and slightly weaker over 7–30 days, continues to soften or reverses higher; a bounce in the dollar alongside high yields and high VIX would underscore global de-risking and likely coincide with additional equity downside.

## 1. Pulse

Across assets, the tone has shifted cautiously risk-off. Major US equity indices were marginally lower on the last cash session (S&P 500 -0.06%, Dow -0.17%, Nasdaq -0.06%), with only the Russell 2000 eking out a gain (+0.12%). Under the surface, however, risk appetite has been stronger over the past month, with the Russell 2000 up 6.6% and the Dow up 3.1%, indicating that the latest pullback is modest relative to recent gains.

Volatility and futures are signalling a sharper deterioration in sentiment than the spot indices alone. The VIX has spiked 28.6% in 1d and 32.0% over 7d to 20.4, while S&P, Nasdaq, Dow and Russell futures are all down between roughly 1.5% and 2.0% on the day, with Nasdaq futures the weakest at -2.0% 1d and -2.0% 7d. This combination of rising implied volatility and sizable overnight futures declines points to fading risk appetite near term despite the mild cash index moves.

The 10Y Treasury yield is grinding higher (up 1.7% 1d and 4.3% over 30d to 4.23%), which tightens financial conditions, while gold has surged 3.3% on the day and 12.5% over 30d, a classic safety bid.

Taken together, modest headline index declines mask a deterioration in underlying risk metrics, leaving the tape looking more cautious than the surface would suggest.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership has rotated toward small caps and value over the last week, with the Russell 2000 up 3.97% 7d and 0.12% 1d, and the Dow up 0.74% 7d and 3.08% over 30d. In contrast, large-cap growth and tech proxies are lagging, as the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.29% over 7d and the QQQ ETF is down 0.44% 7d and 0.23% over 30d, with both QQQ and SPY off 0.08% on the day.
