  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities and futures, the tone is modestly risk-on in the very near term but still fragile over the week. Major US indices are green on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.90%, and Dow 30 up 0.47%, while Russell 2000 is flat to slightly negative at -0.05%. Futures mirror this with S&P futures up 0.67% and Nasdaq futures up 0.84%, though all major equity benchmarks remain slightly negative over 7 days (S&P -0.47%, Nasdaq -0.94%, Dow -1.12%), indicating that today's improvement is a bounce rather than a full trend reversal.
  
  Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of risk-taking on the session. The VIX is down 5.64% on the day to 19.09, easing from elevated recent levels even though it remains 24.12% higher over 30 days, which reflects that risk appetite is improving today but from a more cautious baseline. The 10Y Treasury yield is essentially stable on the day (+0.27% to 4.09%) and slightly lower over 7 and 30 days (around -1.5% and -1.3%), signaling no acute rate shock; overall, the combination of lower spot volatility, stable-to-softer yields, and a roughly 0.60% average 1d index gain points to a near-term pickup in risk appetite.
  
  Cross-asset signals are mixed but lean constructive for risk. Gold futures are up 1.68% on the day and 13.71% over 30 days, and WTI crude is nearly flat on the day but up 18.57% over 30 days, showing ongoing demand for hedges and cyclical commodities even as equities rebound. The US Dollar is slightly weaker today (-0.13%) after a 1.03% gain over the week, which marginally supports risk assets; taken together, the data show improving risk appetite on the day, but the elevated VIX over the month and negative 7d equity performance suggest that underlying risk sentiment has not fully normalized.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive in the short term. Breadth shows 10 instruments up versus 5 down, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.60% indicates a broadly constructive session rather than a narrow squeeze. The VIX declining 5.64% today to 19.09, alongside a relatively steady 10Y yield near 4.09 and slightly lower over the past week, suggests calmer conditions and no immediate stress from rates. However, the fact that key indices are still down over 7 days means the market is in recovery mode rather than in a clearly robust, trending uptrend.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is clearly in large-cap growth and tech. The Nasdaq Composite is a standout on the upside with a 1-day gain of 0.90%, echoed by QQQ up 0.88%, while gold futures also show strong performance at +1.68%. On the downside, small caps are lagging, with the Russell 2000 slightly negative at -0.05% on the day and Russell futures essentially flat at -0.01%, making small caps the notable underperformers versus the large-cap benchmarks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** The dominant macro theme driving the tape is reduced trade policy risk, specifically the US Supreme Court blocking major Trump-era tariffs. According to the news, this has fueled a strong US stock market rally, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all higher on the day and the Nasdaq up around 0.85–0.90%. This development is clearly risk-on, particularly for globally exposed tech and retail names, as evidenced by gains in Amazon (over 2%) and Nvidia (over 1%), and it aligns with the broader outperformance of the Nasdaq and QQQ relative to other benchmarks in the last 24 hours. Another visible theme is renewed leadership by the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech stocks. The news notes that these names powered the rally, especially in response to the lower perceived trade risk after the Supreme Court decision, which channels more capital into high-beta growth. This concentration of gains in large-cap tech is risk-on for the broader indices today, but it also means the rally is somewhat narrow in leadership, which can leave the market more vulnerable if sentiment toward these specific names changes. Idiosyncratic corporate news such as the Nasdaq notification to NaaS Technology regarding minimum market value of listed securities is present but appears micro and not broadly market-moving. The notice clarifies that there is no immediate delisting and no immediate impact on trading of the stock, so its effect on overall risk sentiment is negligible. As a result, macro and policy headlines, rather than single-name regulatory developments, are the primary drivers of today's risk-on tape.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%: The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given that major indices and futures are already higher today (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%, S&P futures +0.67%, Nasdaq futures +0.84%) on a clear risk-on catalyst (Supreme Court blocking tariffs) and a 5.64% drop in VIX. While 7-day returns remain slightly negative and VIX is elevated over 30 days, indicating underlying caution, the immediate shift toward lower volatility, stable 10Y yields, and tech leadership suggests incremental follow-through is more probable than a sharp reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can build on today's gains in the futures market, using the current levels of around 6,923 on S&P futures and 25,068 on Nasdaq futures as near-term reference points. Sustained trade above these marks would reinforce the risk-on message from the Supreme Court tariff decision, while a move back toward last week's levels (for example, S&P futures around 6,961 over 7 days) would indicate fading momentum. Monitoring the VIX around 19 is also key: continued slippage lower from here would confirm stabilizing sentiment, while a reversal higher would argue against further upside. Sector-wise, focus should remain on megacap tech and consumer names linked to global trade, given that the Magnificent Seven, Amazon, and Nvidia have been explicitly cited as powering the rally. If these leaders continue to outperform relative to lagging small caps such as the Russell 2000 (currently slightly negative on the day), the indices can grind higher even with uneven breadth. Additionally, keep an eye on gold and crude—gold's strong 1-day and 30-day gains and crude's 30-day surge above 18% mean any sharp reversals there could signal a shift in macro hedging behavior that might spill over into equity risk appetite. Rates and the dollar should also be monitored closely into the next session to validate the up-bias. The 10Y yield near 4.09 has drifted slightly lower over 7 and 30 days; if it stays contained or edges lower, that will help underpin equity valuations, whereas a sudden spike would challenge today's gains. The US Dollar Index, slightly softer on the day at -0.13% after a +1.03% 7-day move, is another barometer—continued mild dollar softness would support global risk assets, while renewed dollar strength could cap upside, especially in the more trade-sensitive parts of the market.

## 1. Pulse

Across equities and futures, the tone is modestly risk-on in the very near term but still fragile over the week. Major US indices are green on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.69%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.90%, and Dow 30 up 0.47%, while Russell 2000 is flat to slightly negative at -0.05%. Futures mirror this with S&P futures up 0.67% and Nasdaq futures up 0.84%, though all major equity benchmarks remain slightly negative over 7 days (S&P -0.47%, Nasdaq -0.94%, Dow -1.12%), indicating that today's improvement is a bounce rather than a full trend reversal.

Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of risk-taking on the session. The VIX is down 5.64% on the day to 19.09, easing from elevated recent levels even though it remains 24.12% higher over 30 days, which reflects that risk appetite is improving today but from a more cautious baseline. The 10Y Treasury yield is essentially stable on the day (+0.27% to 4.09%) and slightly lower over 7 and 30 days (around -1.5% and -1.3%), signaling no acute rate shock; overall, the combination of lower spot volatility, stable-to-softer yields, and a roughly 0.60% average 1d index gain points to a near-term pickup in risk appetite.

Cross-asset signals are mixed but lean constructive for risk. Gold futures are up 1.68% on the day and 13.71% over 30 days, and WTI crude is nearly flat on the day but up 18.57% over 30 days, showing ongoing demand for hedges and cyclical commodities even as equities rebound. The US Dollar is slightly weaker today (-0.13%) after a 1.03% gain over the week, which marginally supports risk assets; taken together, the data show improving risk appetite on the day, but the elevated VIX over the month and negative 7d equity performance suggest that underlying risk sentiment has not fully normalized.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive in the short term. Breadth shows 10 instruments up versus 5 down, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.60% indicates a broadly constructive session rather than a narrow squeeze. The VIX declining 5.64% today to 19.09, alongside a relatively steady 10Y yield near 4.09 and slightly lower over the past week, suggests calmer conditions and no immediate stress from rates. However, the fact that key indices are still down over 7 days means the market is in recovery mode rather than in a clearly robust, trending uptrend.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is clearly in large-cap growth and tech. The Nasdaq Composite is a standout on the upside with a 1-day gain of 0.90%, echoed by QQQ up 0.88%, while gold futures also show strong performance at +1.68%. On the downside, small caps are lagging, with the Russell 2000 slightly negative at -0.05% on the day and Russell futures essentially flat at -0.01%, making small caps the notable underperformers versus the large-cap benchmarks.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** The dominant macro theme driving the tape is reduced trade policy risk, specifically the US Supreme Court blocking major Trump-era tariffs. According to the news, this has fueled a strong US stock market rally, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all higher on the day and the Nasdaq up around 0.85–0.90%. This development is clearly risk-on, particularly for globally exposed tech and retail names, as evidenced by gains in Amazon (over 2%) and Nvidia (over 1%), and it aligns with the broader outperformance of the Nasdaq and QQQ relative to other benchmarks in the last 24 hours. Another visible theme is renewed leadership by the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech stocks. The news notes that these names powered the rally, especially in response to the lower perceived trade risk after the Supreme Court decision, which channels more capital into high-beta growth. This concentration of gains in large-cap tech is risk-on for the broader indices today, but it also means the rally is somewhat narrow in leadership, which can leave the market more vulnerable if sentiment toward these specific names changes. Idiosyncratic corporate news such as the Nasdaq notification to NaaS Technology regarding minimum market value of listed securities is present but appears micro and not broadly market-moving. The notice clarifies that there is no immediate delisting and no immediate impact on trading of the stock, so its effect on overall risk sentiment is negligible. As a result, macro and policy headlines, rather than single-name regulatory developments, are the primary drivers of today's risk-on tape.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60%: The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given that major indices and futures are already higher today (S&P 500 +0.69%, Nasdaq +0.90%, S&P futures +0.67%, Nasdaq futures +0.84%) on a clear risk-on catalyst (Supreme Court blocking tariffs) and a 5.64% drop in VIX. While 7-day returns remain slightly negative and VIX is elevated over 30 days, indicating underlying caution, the immediate shift toward lower volatility, stable 10Y yields, and tech leadership suggests incremental follow-through is more probable than a sharp reversal.

3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can build on today's gains in the futures market, using the current levels of around 6,923 on S&P futures and 25,068 on Nasdaq futures as near-term reference points. Sustained trade above these marks would reinforce the risk-on message from the Supreme Court tariff decision, while a move back toward last week's levels (for example, S&P futures around 6,961 over 7 days) would indicate fading momentum. Monitoring the VIX around 19 is also key: continued slippage lower from here would confirm stabilizing sentiment, while a reversal higher would argue against further upside. Sector-wise, focus should remain on megacap tech and consumer names linked to global trade, given that the Magnificent Seven, Amazon, and Nvidia have been explicitly cited as powering the rally. If these leaders continue to outperform relative to lagging small caps such as the Russell 2000 (currently slightly negative on the day), the indices can grind higher even with uneven breadth. Additionally, keep an eye on gold and crude—gold's strong 1-day and 30-day gains and crude's 30-day surge above 18% mean any sharp reversals there could signal a shift in macro hedging behavior that might spill over into equity risk appetite. Rates and the dollar should also be monitored closely into the next session to validate the up-bias. The 10Y yield near 4.09 has drifted slightly lower over 7 and 30 days; if it stays contained or edges lower, that will help underpin equity valuations, whereas a sudden spike would challenge today's gains. The US Dollar Index, slightly softer on the day at -0.13% after a +1.03% 7-day move, is another barometer—continued mild dollar softness would support global risk assets, while renewed dollar strength could cap upside, especially in the more trade-sensitive parts of the market.
