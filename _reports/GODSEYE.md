  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone in the very near term, as all major U.S. indices are higher on the day and the average index move is +0.69%. The S&P 500 is up +0.63%, the Dow +0.49%, the Nasdaq Composite +0.51%, and small caps are outperforming with the Russell 2000 up +1.24%, indicating broad participation and a tilt toward higher-beta exposure. This marks a rebound versus the last week, where all four benchmarks are still slightly negative over 7 days, but it aligns with a constructive 30-day trend, particularly in the Russell (+5.26%).","Volatility and futures also reinforce an improving risk appetite. The VIX is down -4.83% on the day and -25.63% over 30 days to 14.19, signaling investors are willing to pay less for downside protection. Equity futures are strongly higher, with S&P futures +1.97%, Nasdaq futures +2.20%, Dow futures +1.31%, and Russell futures +2.70% on the day, showing buyers pressing risk after the cash close and confirming that near-term sentiment has turned decisively risk-on.","Rates and cross-asset signals are somewhat mixed but not yet choking off risk-taking. The 10Y Treasury yield is modestly higher at 4.17% (1d +0.43%, 30d +1.86%), suggesting a slight headwind from higher discount rates, yet this is being outweighed for now by equity optimism. At the same time, the U.S. dollar is softer (DXY -0.31% on the day, -1.31% over 30 days), while gold and crude are both up more than 2% on the day, a combination that points to healthy risk appetite with a parallel bid for real assets rather than outright risk aversion."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the short term. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up versus only 2 down, and the average index move of about +0.69% shows gains are broad-based rather than narrowly driven. A VIX at 14.19 and down nearly 5% on the day indicates contained equity volatility, while the modest rise in the 10Y yield to 4.17% has not derailed the advance. Taken together, this points to a market that is short-term healthy and resilient, even if 7-day index changes remain slightly negative and warrant monitoring for follow-through.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in small caps and high-beta futures, with the Russell 2000 up +1.24% and Russell futures up +2.70%, while Nasdaq futures are also a strong standout at +2.20%. On the lagging side for the day, QQQ is still positive but underperforming at +0.34%, and the Dow is relatively softer at +0.49% compared with other equity benchmarks. Over the last week, all major equity indices are slightly negative, with QQQ down -1.02% and the Russell 2000 down -1.15%, marking them as recent laggards despite today's rebound, while Dow futures are nearly flat over 7 days at -0.06%, making them a relative weekly outperformer.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The tape is being driven by a rebound in tech and broader growth sentiment. News flow highlights that recent stock gains were led by strength in tech, with articles citing that tech boosts market sentiment and that Asian markets are taking cues from a tech recovery in the U.S. This tech-led improvement is consistent with Nasdaq futures up +2.20% and the Nasdaq Composite up +0.51% today, supporting a risk-on bias as investors re-engage with growth and AI-related names after prior pressure.","Global monetary policy, particularly the Bank of Japan's rate hike, is another key macro driver. Headlines note that Japan raised rates to a three-decade high, lifting global bond yields but also coinciding with rallies in Asia and a weaker yen, and S&P futures are described as gaining on rate-cut hopes elsewhere despite higher Japanese yields. This mix suggests markets are digesting tighter policy abroad while still leaning toward a benign global liquidity backdrop, which supports risk-on behavior in equities and crypto, as seen in the positive moves in U.S. equity futures and commentary about lifted Asian risk appetite.","Oil and gold moves, along with U.S. dollar softness, round out the macro picture. Crude is up +2.47% on the day and gold is surging +2.57% (and nearly +11.85% over 30 days), while the dollar index is down -0.31% on the day and -1.31% over 30 days. Coupled with news that oil is climbing as markets weigh jobs data and geopolitical decisions, this pattern points to markets pricing in a mix of steady demand and some inflation/hedging demand for real assets, but the concurrent strength in equities and decline in the dollar characterize this more as a pro-risk environment than a classic flight to safety."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours include U.S. macro and political developments referenced in recent headlines, such as markets weighing jobs data signals that have been influencing futures and oil, and a primetime policy-focused speech from President Trump that could shift expectations around tariffs or economic measures. In addition, central bank narratives remain in focus, with lingering market reaction to the Bank of Japan's recent rate hike and ongoing positioning around major central bank decisions that have kept the dollar and global yields in motion. Company-specific catalysts are relatively light in the provided data; one named corporate event is Darden Restaurants' upcoming earnings, which could affect consumer and restaurant-related sentiment but is unlikely to move the broad indices materially on its own.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given the strong risk-on tone in futures (S&P +1.97%, Nasdaq +2.20%, Russell +2.70%) and broad gains across cash indices today. The low and falling VIX (-4.83% to 14.19) and strong breadth (13 up, 2 down) suggest that dip-buying and momentum flows are in control despite slightly higher 10Y yields. While 7-day returns are still marginally negative, the combination of tech-led sentiment, supportive global risk tone after the Bank of Japan move, and softening dollar tilts the bias toward some additional upside rather than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether small-cap and tech leadership persists, particularly the Russell 2000 around the 2,560 area and Nasdaq futures near 25,685, as these have been the strongest risk barometers. S&P 500 futures near 6,930–6,950 will be key for confirming follow-through; sustained trade above today's futures gains would validate the up bias, while a quick reversal there would hint at exhaustion in the rally. Monitoring QQQ, which lagged on the day at +0.34%, can also help gauge whether mega-cap tech fully re-engages or rotation continues into broader risk.","On the macro side, keep a close eye on the 10Y yield around 4.17% and the U.S. dollar index near 98.3, because further backing up in yields or a sharp dollar rebound could pressure equities and commodities. Moves in gold (now 4,473.5) and WTI crude (58.06) will indicate whether today's strong bid for real assets is continuing in a benign, pro-risk fashion or starting to reflect anxiety about inflation or geopolitics. Finally, any headlines that shift expectations around U.S. jobs data, central bank paths, or the upcoming Trump policy speech could quickly alter rate and FX dynamics and thus the equity tape, so futures reaction around those news points will be critical to watch.",""]

["Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone in the very near term, as all major U.S. indices are higher on the day and the average index move is +0.69%.
