  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across assets, the tone is distinctly risk-on. Major US equity benchmarks are all higher on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.91%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.67%, Dow 30 up 1.43%, and small caps in the Russell 2000 outperforming with a 2.14% gain. On a 7-day view, the S&P 500 (+0.47%), Nasdaq (+0.55%), and Russell 2000 (+3.26%) are positive, indicating that risk appetite is not just a one-day phenomenon but has been building over the past week despite the Dow being roughly flat over that period (-0.07%).
  
  Volatility and rates are confirming this improving risk sentiment. The VIX is down 9.55% on the day (to 18.56) and lower by 10.81% over 30 days, signaling reduced demand for downside protection as equities grind higher. The 10-year Treasury yield has slipped to about 4.00%, down 0.89% on the day and 3.52% over the week, which aligns with market narratives of a softer Fed and supports equity valuations. Futures are also reinforcing the positive tone: S&P futures are up 1.13% on the day, Dow futures +1.61%, Nasdaq futures +0.84%, and Russell futures +2.34%, showing continued risk appetite into the next session.
  
  Cross-asset signals are broadly supportive, with some nuance. Gold futures are up 2.08% on the day and 2.18% over the week, suggesting that while equity risk appetite is improving, there is still demand for safety or inflation hedges. WTI crude is softer, down 1.27% on the day and 3.33% over the week, and the US dollar index is marginally lower on the day (-0.31%) but modestly higher over 7 and 30 days. Overall, the combination of rising equities, falling volatility, easing yields, and firm futures indicates that risk appetite is clearly improving rather than fading.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly constructive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is strong, with 11 assets up versus only 4 down, and the average 1-day index move of about +1.12% points to broad-based buying rather than a narrow leadership spike. The sharp 9.55% drop in the VIX alongside a roughly 0.89% decline in the 10-year yield to about 4.00% suggests a supportive volatility and rate backdrop for equities. Taken together, these metrics indicate a healthy, risk-on tape rather than a fragile or defensive rally.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small caps are the clear leaders, with the Russell 2000 up 2.14% and Russell futures up 2.34%, while the Dow 30 is also a standout large-cap gainer at +1.43%. On a 7-day basis, the Russell 2000 again leads with a 3.26% gain, significantly outpacing the S&P 500 (+0.47%) and Nasdaq Composite (+0.55%), indicating a rotation into higher-beta areas. On the downside, WTI Crude is a notable laggard at -1.27% on the day and -3.33% over the week, and the Dow 30 is the only major US equity index slightly negative over 7 days at -0.07%, making it a relative underperformer on that timeframe.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro expectations around the Federal Reserve and interest rates are a key driver of the current tape. Several headlines reference a "Fed-fueled rebound" and "rate-cut hopes," with commentary that a softer Fed stance has pushed down Treasury yields and supported an "everything rally." This is directly reflected in the 10-year yield falling 3.52% over the week and the VIX dropping 6.40% over the same period, creating a risk-on backdrop that has lifted the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow as investors price in a friendlier policy path. Upcoming and recently delayed US economic data are also front-of-mind for investors. News flow highlights that futures are wobbling as markets focus on retail sales and inflation data, and another piece notes that a string of economic releases in a holiday-shortened week could add volatility. This data focus can swing sentiment risk-on if numbers support the soft-landing and rate-cut narrative, or risk-off if they challenge it, but for now the combination of rising equities and falling yields suggests the market is leaning optimistically into these releases. Sector and thematic drivers around AI and tech leadership continue to influence risk appetite. Reports of an Alphabet-led AI rally, Nvidia-fueled optimism, and even JPMorgan’s discussion of an "everything rally" tied to AI strength have coincided with the Nasdaq Composite rising 0.67% on the day and 2.24% over 30 days, with QQQ up 1.82% over the month. This tech and AI enthusiasm is clearly contributing to a risk-on tone in growth assets, although the concurrent bid in gold and crypto-focused headlines indicate that some investors are still hedging or diversifying exposure around these themes.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key potential triggers over the next 24 hours include US retail sales and inflation data releases, which multiple headlines flag as central to the near-term outlook, especially in the context of a holiday-shortened, potentially more volatile trading week. Any surprises in these prints could quickly shift expectations around Fed policy, directly impacting Treasury yields and equity valuations. In addition, broader US economic data scheduled this week, referenced as a "string of economic data," will further shape risk sentiment as investors test the current rate-cut and soft-landing narrative.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence; Equities are broadly higher with an average 1-day index gain of about 1.12%, led by a 2.14% jump in the Russell 2000, while the VIX is down 9.55% and the 10-year yield has eased to roughly 4.00%, all of which signal constructive risk appetite. Futures are confirming this with S&P (+1.13%), Dow (+1.61%), Nasdaq (+0.84%), and Russell (+2.34%) all higher, implying positive carry into the next session. Macro news highlighting Fed-driven optimism and rate-cut hopes ahead of US retail sales and inflation data suggests markets are leaning risk-on into those catalysts, though the data risk tempers confidence from being higher.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P 500 futures can hold gains around the recent 6,797 level and whether cash S&P can build on its 0.91% move from 6,705.12 to 6,765.88, as sustained strength there would validate the current up bias. The Russell 2000 near 2,466 and Russell futures around 2,475 are key barometers of risk-on sentiment; continued outperformance of small caps after a 2.14–2.34% pop would signal deeper conviction in the rally rather than just a one-day squeeze. Macro-wise, the trajectory of the 10-year yield around the 4.00% mark and the VIX near 18.56 will be critical for confirming the constructive tone; further easing in yields or another leg lower in volatility would support additional equity upside. Sector-wise, keep an eye on tech and AI-linked proxies such as the Nasdaq Composite (23,025.59, +0.67% on the day) and QQQ (608.89, +0.62%), since news flow ties much of the broader rally to AI and Fed narratives. Finally, monitor the reaction around the release of US retail sales and inflation data flagged in headlines, as any sharp deviation from expectations could quickly challenge or reinforce the current risk-on positioning.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Across assets, the tone is distinctly risk-on. Major US equity benchmarks are all higher on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.91%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.67%, Dow 30 up 1.43%, and small caps in the Russell 2000 outperforming with a 2.14% gain. On a 7-day view, the S&P 500 (+0.47%), Nasdaq (+0.55%), and Russell 2000 (+3.26%) are positive, indicating that risk appetite is not just a one-day phenomenon but has been building over the past week despite the Dow being roughly flat over that period (-0.07%).

The VIX is down 9.55% on the day (to 18.56) and lower by 10.81% over 30 days, signaling reduced demand for downside protection as equities grind higher.

Gold futures are up 2.08% on the day and 2.18% over the week, suggesting that while equity risk appetite is improving, there is still demand for safety or inflation hedges. WTI crude is softer, down 1.27% on the day and 3.33% over the week, and the US dollar index is marginally lower on the day (-0.31%) but modestly higher over 7 and 30 days.

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence; Equities are broadly higher with an average 1-day index gain of about 1.12%, led by a 2.14% jump in the Russell 2000, while the VIX is down 9.55% and the 10-year yield has eased to roughly 4.00%, all of which signal constructive risk appetite.
