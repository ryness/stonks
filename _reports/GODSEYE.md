  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are in a constructive, modest risk-on tone, with the S&P 500 up 0.19% on the day, the Dow 0.22%, and the Nasdaq Composite 0.31%, while the Russell 2000 slipped 0.38%. Over the past week, all four U.S. benchmarks are higher by 1.5%–2.4%, indicating improving risk appetite despite today's small-cap underperformance. QQQ's 0.41% daily gain and 2.72% rise over 7 days underscores ongoing leadership from large-cap growth and tech.","Volatility and futures confirm this risk-friendly backdrop. The VIX fell 2.35% on the day and is down 16.97% over the week to 15.41, pointing to fading demand for protection as indices grind higher. S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are each up 0.19%–0.44% on the day and about 1.4%–2.6% over the week, while Russell futures lag with a 0.42% daily drop but still gain 2.16% on the week, suggesting risk appetite is broadly improving but with some hesitation toward small caps.","Rates and cross-asset moves are a mild offset to the bullish tone. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.75% on the day and 3.42% over the week to 4.14%, showing some upward pressure on yields even as equities advance. Gold is higher by 0.38% on the day and 2.14% on the week, crude is up 0.79% on the day and 3.78% on the week, and the dollar is flat on the day and slightly weaker on the week, a configuration consistent with a measured risk-on environment rather than an aggressive reach for safety or liquidity."
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive but not euphoric. Breadth is constructive, with 11 assets up versus 4 down and an average 1-day index change of +0.16%, showing a broad if moderate advance. Volatility is dropping, with the VIX at 15.41 and down nearly 17% over the week, while the 10Y yield has risen to 4.14% but hasn't derailed equity gains. Taken together, this points to a healthy, steady tape where risk appetite is improving despite a less accommodative rates backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day sits with growth and tech-linked benchmarks: the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.31% and QQQ rose 0.41%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.44%. On the downside, small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.38% and Russell futures off 0.42% on the day. Over the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (+2.40%) and QQQ (+2.72%) clearly outperform, while even the lagging Russell 2000 still posts a solid 2.25% weekly gain, confirming broad but growth-led leadership.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy expectations are the key drivers of the current tape. Headlines note that U.S. stocks have been rallying as traders price in rate-cut hopes, with one article highlighting that large-cap indexes recently struggled while the Russell 2000 rallied about 1% on mounting rate-cut bets; that dynamic aligns with this week's 2.25% gain in the Russell 2000 and a 3.42% rise in the 10Y yield, suggesting shifting views on the timing and path of policy rather than a simple lower-yield rally. Another piece points out that U.S. stocks are little changed with few immediate catalysts ahead of the next Federal Reserve decision, reinforcing a wait-and-see, but still generally risk-on, stance.","Labor market data and corporate actions are also shaping risk sentiment. The news flow references U.S. jobless claims at their lowest levels since 2021, which supports growth expectations and helps explain why equities can rise even as the 10Y yield climbs over the past week. At the same time, company-specific headlines such as Meta's job cuts illustrate ongoing cost control and margin focus in large-cap tech, consistent with the strong 1-day and 7-day performance of the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, encouraging a risk-on tilt in growth sectors."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers within the next 24 hours are dominated by macro data and central bank events highlighted in the news. U.S. weekly jobless claims are specifically flagged as a key release, with markets watching whether they stay near the lowest levels since 2021, which could support equities but keep upward pressure on yields. In addition, commentary references the market waiting on the next Federal Reserve decision, so any new Fed-related remarks or data that shift rate-cut expectations could move both rates and equity futures. Outside the U.S., the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy decision is cited as a near-term catalyst for Indian markets and regional risk sentiment, though its direct impact on U.S. benchmarks is likely more limited.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given that major U.S. benchmarks are all higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.19%, Dow +0.22%, Nasdaq +0.31%) and show strong gains over the past week alongside a 16.97% drop in the VIX to 15.41. Futures across S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow are also up 0.19%–0.44% on the day and roughly 1.4%–2.6% over the week, reflecting persistent dip-buying and a constructive tone. While the 10Y yield has risen 3.42% over the week and upcoming jobless claims or Fed-related headlines could introduce volatility, the prevailing risk-on bias and broad positive breadth tilt the balance toward a slightly higher tape.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should monitor whether large-cap growth can maintain leadership and keep the S&P 500 grinding higher from its 6,870 level and Nasdaq Composite from 23,578, especially with Nasdaq futures already up 2.59% on the week to 25,735. Sustained strength in QQQ, which is up 0.41% on the day and 2.72% over the week, will be key for the bullish bias; any reversal there could quickly weigh on broader indices. The Russell 2000 around 2,521 remains an important gauge of risk appetite, as today's 0.38% drop contrasts with its 2.25% weekly gain and may flag sensitivity to rates or macro headlines.","On the macro side, watch the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.14% and the VIX around 15.4 as key barometers of whether the calm, risk-on regime persists. Further yield backing up without a corresponding rise in volatility would signal resilience in equities, while a sharp VIX rebound from current depressed levels could indicate hedging ahead of the next Fed decision or labor data. Cross-asset signals from gold (up 2.14% on the week) and crude (up 3.78% on the week) should also be tracked for signs of shifting inflation or growth expectations that could challenge the current upward bias."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equities are in a constructive, modest risk-on tone, with the S&P 500 up 0.19% on the day, the Dow 0.22%, and the Nasdaq Composite 0.31%, while the Russell 2000 slipped 0.38%.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day sits with growth and tech-linked benchmarks: the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.31% and QQQ rose 0.41%, while Nasdaq futures added 0.44%. On the downside, small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.38% and Russell futures off 0.42% on the day. Over the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (+2.40%) and QQQ (+2.72%) clearly outperform, while even the lagging Russell 2000 still posts a solid 2.25% weekly gain, confirming broad but growth-led leadership.
