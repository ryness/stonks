  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-10T20:26:57.069752+00:00">2025-11-10 20:26 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 18s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a clear risk-on rebound: S&P 500 +1.59%, Nasdaq Composite +2.31%, and Russell 2000 +1.39% on the day, with breadth running 13 up vs 2 down and average index change at +1.30%. Futures confirm the tone with S&P +1.59%, Nasdaq +2.17%, Russell +1.36%, and Dow +0.85% over 1d.
  
  Volatility eased meaningfully, with VIX down 6.87% to 17.77, signaling improving risk appetite today, though it remains higher on a 7d (+5.09%) and 30d (+10.24%) basis that keeps some caution in the backdrop. That mix points to a relief bid after recent stress rather than an all-clear.
  
  Rates are not the driver of the rally: the 10Y Treasury yield ticked up to 4.11% (+0.42% 1d) while the US Dollar was essentially flat (-0.02% 1d). Defensive signals are mixed as gold jumped +2.95% on the day even as stocks rallied, suggesting the bid is growth/tech-led while macro hedges remain in demand.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid on the day with 13 advancers versus 2 decliners and an average index gain of 1.30%. The VIX fell 6.87% to 17.77, a supportive sign, but it is still up 10.24% over 30 days, implying lingering fragility. The 10Y at 4.11% is little changed over 30 days (-0.75%), so rates are not tightening into the bounce. Overall: healthier near-term tone, tempered by recently elevated volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to growth: the Nasdaq Composite led at +2.31% 1d and QQQ rose +2.22%. Laggards included the Dow 30 at just +0.16% 1d, underperforming the tape, while volatility declined sharply with VIX -6.87% 1d. Over the week, SPY lagged at -2.39% 7d, whereas Gold outperformed at +2.90% 7d.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Recent tech-driven turbulence remains a key macro theme, with headlines citing the worst tech sell-off since April, focus on Musk’s $1T pay package, and valuation concerns. That backdrop aligns with the weekly softness in Nasdaq (7d -0.19%) despite today’s +2.31% rebound and a VIX still higher over 7d, combining to a risk-off narrative earlier in the week and a risk-on relief bid today. Investors are watching U.S. economic signals amid mentions of a cooling labor market and government shutdown uncertainty, which has kept broader risk sentiment choppy. The 10Y yield at 4.11% and gold’s strength (+2.95% 1d, +7.76% 30d) suggest ongoing macro hedging even as equities rally, keeping the tape sensitive to incremental data and policy headlines.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% The day’s broad advance (average index +1.30%) with strong growth leadership (Nasdaq +2.31%) and a 6.87% drop in VIX points to improving risk appetite, while futures corroborate gains. Confidence is moderated by weekly softness (e.g., SPY -2.39% 7d) and a still-elevated VIX over 30 days.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P futures hold around 6,861 and cash S&P near 6,800; a sustained bid above these levels would support the up-bias. For growth leadership, monitor Nasdaq futures near 25,700 and QQQ around 620–625; continued outperformance would validate the tech-led rebound. Keep an eye on VIX holding below 18; further compression would reinforce risk-on conditions. In rates, 10Y yield stability around 4.10–4.15% would help equities; a sharp rise could cap the rally. Track small caps via Russell futures near 2,470 for confirmation of breadth, and note gold near 4,100 and WTI around $60 as barometers of macro hedging versus growth sentiment; a steady gold bid alongside rising equities may signal lingering caution even if indexes push higher.
