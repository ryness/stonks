  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Risk appetite is improving across major US equity benchmarks, with the S&P 500 up 0.25% on the day and 4.44% over the past week, the Dow up 0.39% and 3.76%, and the Nasdaq leading with a 0.59% 1d gain and 6.05% over 7d. Futures are even more constructive, with S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts all higher by roughly 2.0%–2.9% on the latest 1d snapshot, indicating strong follow-through demand into the next session and reinforcing a risk-on tone.","Volatility and rates are consistent with this constructive backdrop: the VIX is down 3.77% on the day and a sharp 37.21% over the week to 16.59, signaling a meaningful compression in risk premia as equities have rallied. The 10-year Treasury yield is marginally lower on the day (-0.24% 1d, -0.49% 7d), suggesting modest support from rates without a disorderly bond selloff, while the US dollar is slightly softer over 1d and 7d as gold surges 3.89% on the day, showing that while risk appetite has improved notably, some hedging via hard assets remains in place.","Breadth data show 10 instruments up versus 5 down, and the average 1d index gain of about 0.34% confirms that the advance is relatively broad-based rather than confined to a single benchmark, though the Russell 2000's -0.17% 1d decline highlights some hesitation in small caps. On balance, the combination of rising equities, sharply lower implied volatility, mildly lower yields, and strong index futures points to a clear improvement in risk appetite over the last week, even as select segments and the gold bid hint at ongoing macro caution."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive given that 10 assets are advancing against 5 declining and the average 1d index move is a gain of about 0.34%, with all major large-cap US benchmarks in the green. The sharp 37% drop in the VIX over the past week to 16.59 underscores a normalization in volatility conditions as equities have pushed higher. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield is slightly lower over 1d and 7d, indicating no acute stress coming from the rates market. Taken together, breadth, modest average gains, and calmer volatility and rates point to a generally healthy market backdrop rather than a narrow, fragile melt-up.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day and week, growth and tech-linked benchmarks are leading, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.59% on the day and 6.05% over the week and QQQ up 0.78% 1d and 6.20% 7d, supported by news of Nvidia climbing nearly 3% and stronger tech sentiment. The Russell 2000 is the notable laggard on a 1d basis at -0.17%, and is also down 1.40% over 30 days, suggesting small caps are not participating as strongly in the rally. On a weekly view, however, even the Russell has rallied 6.94%, so the main divergence near term is between large-cap growth leadership and a softer small-cap tape.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The tape is being driven primarily by improving risk sentiment in US equities, anchored by tech strength and crypto stabilization. One key catalyst is Nvidia's nearly 3% gain, which helped lift broader tech and pushed the Nasdaq higher, while Bitcoin steadying above $89,000 after a sharp earlier drop has eased immediate concerns around a spillover from crypto volatility, contributing to the S&P 500's 0.32% gain and Nasdaq's 0.79% rise in the referenced session, a clear risk-on impulse.","Global macro and policy expectations are also in the background, with Indian markets opening slightly lower and trading cautiously as investors track global cues and RBI policy outlook, and separate coverage highlighting that US rate-cut hopes have supported IT stocks elsewhere. This mix of central-bank-watching and cautious international equity tone contrasts with the stronger US rebound, but does not appear to be triggering broad risk-off flows, instead tempering exuberance at the margin. Geopolitical headlines around Ukraine and US military actions are present in the newsflow but are not explicitly tied in the data to major moves in the core benchmarks, so their effect on near-term risk appetite in these metrics appears limited or indirect."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The specific economic releases or corporate earnings over the next 24 hours that could move the market are not identified in the provided data, beyond generalized references to US economic data and RBI policy outlook being monitored by Indian investors, so the key upcoming triggers are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence – Large-cap US indices have posted moderate gains over the last day (S&P 500 +0.25%, Nasdaq +0.59%, Dow +0.39%), breadth is positive, and the VIX has compressed sharply, all pointing to a strengthening risk-on backdrop. Index futures are showing notably stronger 1d gains (S&P Fut +2.01%, Nasdaq Fut +2.91%, Dow Fut +2.47%, Russell Fut +2.40%), which supports a constructive bias into the next session. With 10-year yields slightly softer and no clearly negative new macro shocks in the provided news, the balance of evidence favors further upside over the next 24 hours, though the rebound in gold and the Russell 2000's small 1d decline argue for moderate rather than high conviction.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P futures around 6,856 and Nasdaq futures near 25,674 can hold their recent 2%–3% 1d gains and translate them into follow-through strength in the cash markets, particularly in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which is already up 6.05% over the week. Maintaining these futures levels would confirm the current risk-on tone signaled by the sharp 37% weekly drop in the VIX and support the call for an upward bias.","Sector-wise, tech and growth proxies such as the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, which gained 0.59% and 0.78% on the day respectively, will be important to monitor to see if Nvidia-led enthusiasm persists and continues to drive leadership. At the same time, the Russell 2000's slight 1d decline to 2,464.98 despite a strong 7d gain suggests traders should watch small caps and the Russell futures near 2,477 for signs of participation or renewed underperformance that could either broaden or narrow the rally.","On the macro side, tracking the 10-year Treasury yield around 4.09% and the VIX at 16.59 will be key for confirming the risk-on backdrop; a further drift lower in yields or sustained sub-17 VIX would support additional equity upside, while any snapback in volatility could challenge the bullish futures signal. Additionally, the strong 3.89% 1d jump in gold futures to 4,251.20 should be watched as a barometer of underlying hedging demand; if gold continues to climb alongside equities, it may indicate lingering macro concern even as headline indices push higher."]

LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Risk appetite is improving across major US equity benchmarks, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.25% on the day and 4.44% over the past week, the Dow up 0.39% and 3.76%, and the Nasdaq leading with a 0.59% 1d gain and 6.05% over 7d. Futures are even more constructive, with S&amp;P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts all higher by roughly 2.0%–2.9% on the latest 1d snapshot, indicating strong follow-through demand into the next session and reinforcing a risk-on tone.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and rates are consistent with this constructive backdrop: the VIX is down 3.77% on the day and a sharp 37.21% over the week
