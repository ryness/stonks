  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite improved on the day with broad equity gains and strong breadth: 13 up vs 2 down and an average index move of +1.10%. The Nasdaq Composite led at +2.00% while small caps (Russell 2000) rose +1.02% and SPY gained +1.18%, though the S&P 500 cash index lagged at +0.13%. On a 7-day view, appetite remains softer with the S&P 500 -2.35% and the Dow -0.78%, tempering the day’s rebound.
  
  Volatility eased as VIX fell 5.40% to 18.05, but it remains elevated versus recent history (7d +6.74%, 30d +11.97%), signaling only a partial unwind of stress. Futures confirmed the risk-on tone: S&P +1.18%, Nasdaq +1.90%, Russell +0.93%, and Dow +0.43%. Rates were steady-to-slightly higher with the 10Y at 4.10% (+0.22% 1d, -0.94% 30d), the US Dollar was flat (+0.02% 1d), and commodities were mixed with Gold +2.43% and WTI -0.28%.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks constructive near term: breadth is positive (13 up, 2 down) and the average index change is +1.10% on the day. Volatility eased with VIX down 5.40% to 18.05, though it remains higher on a 7- and 30-day basis, indicating lingering caution. The 10Y Treasury yield is stable at 4.10% (+0.22% 1d, -0.94% 30d), which supports risk assets relative to a month ago. Overall, conditions are improving day-over-day but not fully out of the woods on a weekly horizon.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to growth and tech: the Nasdaq Composite was a standout at +2.00% 1d, and QQQ rose +1.94%. Laggards included the S&P 500 cash index at just +0.13% on the day and it is the weakest major US benchmark over the week at -2.35%; Dow futures also underperformed on the day at +0.43% versus stronger gains elsewhere.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Valuation and tech volatility remain the central macro theme after reports of the worst tech sell-off since April and global spillovers from Big Tech weakness; this backdrop aligns with VIX still up over the past week (+6.74%) and the S&P 500 down -2.35% over 7 days. Today’s rebound in the Nasdaq (+2.00%) suggests dip-buying interest, but the recent news flow underscores that sensitivity to tech headlines continues to drive risk-on/risk-off swings. Caution around U.S. economic signs—including worrisome jobs data and uncertainty cited around a prolonged government shutdown—has weighed on sentiment, consistent with elevated volatility and recent index pullbacks. Crypto ETF outflows on macro jitters and continued focus on AI/chip valuation risk in recent reports have reinforced defensive hedging, echoed by Gold’s +2.43% 1d gain, even as equities staged a short-term bounce.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — Broad-based gains (average index +1.10%, 13 advancers vs 2 decliners), lower VIX on the day (-5.40% to 18.05), and supportive futures (ES +1.18%, NQ +1.90%) point to near-term upside, though confidence is tempered by weaker 7-day performance (e.g., S&P 500 -2.35%) and still-elevated volatility on a weekly basis.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether futures hold gains into the open: ES=F near 6,833 and NQ=F near 25,644. Sustained strength alongside VIX staying near 18 and below its prior 19.08 reference would support follow-through. A 10Y yield anchored around 4.10% would also be consistent with a constructive risk backdrop. Monitor tech leadership and breadth: the Nasdaq Composite (+2.00% 1d) and QQQ (+1.94% 1d) need to maintain leadership for the tape to extend, while small caps (Russell 2000 +1.02%) can confirm cyclicality. Keep an eye on Gold (+2.43% to 4,096.60) and WTI (59.58); cooling in haven demand and stabilization in crude would align better with an ongoing risk-on bias.
