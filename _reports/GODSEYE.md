  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across major U.S. equity benchmarks, the tone is cautiously constructive in the very short term but still soft over the past week. The S&P 500 is up +0.05% on the day but down -0.68% over 7 days, while the Nasdaq Composite is off -0.22% on the day and -1.56% over the week, indicating fading appetite for mega-cap growth and tech. In contrast, small caps are firm, with the Russell 2000 +1.18% on the day and +0.84% over 7 days, suggesting selective risk appetite migrating toward domestically oriented and higher beta names.","Volatility and rates data show a mixed risk tone. The VIX dipped -1.06% on the day but is up +10.52% over 7 days and +37.79% over 30 days to 20.6, signaling that, despite today's modest calm, the volatility regime has shifted higher and investors remain more defensive than a month ago. The 10Y Treasury yield is down -1.17% on the day and -5.12% over 7 days to 4.06%, consistent with a bid for duration and some macro concern, but also easing pressure on equities via a lower discount rate.","Index futures point to a slightly positive but subdued near-term bias. S&P futures are up +0.12% on the day and +0.55% over 7 days, Dow futures are +0.11% on the day and +1.28% over 7 days, while Nasdaq futures are essentially flat on the day (-0.01%) but up +0.61% over the week. Taken together, risk appetite is tentatively improving on a 1–7 day horizon in futures and small caps, but the elevated VIX and negative 7–30 day returns for the S&P and Nasdaq show that overall risk appetite is still meaningfully lower than a month ago."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately stable but not robust. Breadth is slightly positive, with 9 instruments up versus 6 down, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.23% indicates a mild upward bias rather than a strong rally. The backdrop of a higher-vol regime, with VIX at 20.6 and up nearly 38% over 30 days, tempers that constructive read and points to more fragile sentiment. At the same time, the 10Y Treasury yield falling to 4.06% with a -5.1% move over the week provides some support to valuations and cushions overall market stress, keeping conditions in "cautious but functional" territory.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Russell 2000 is the clear equity leader with a +1.18% move, and Dow 30 strength at +0.10% also stands out on the large-cap side. On the negative side, the Nasdaq Composite lags with a -0.22% 1-day decline, reflecting continued pressure on growth and tech. Over the week, Russell 2000 and its futures proxy (Russell Fut +2.54% over 7 days) lead, while the Nasdaq Composite (-1.56% over 7 days) is the primary laggard, underscoring a rotation away from large-cap tech toward small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and policy expectations around U.S. inflation and Federal Reserve rate cuts are a key driver of the tape. News highlights that U.S. stock index futures are "muted" with investors staying on the sidelines ahead of inflation data that could clarify the Fed's rate-cut outlook, which is a classic risk-off posture until the data hits. The recent drop in the 10Y yield by -5.12% over 7 days suggests markets have already leaned toward a slightly easier future policy path, providing some support for equities even as investors remain cautious.","Another important theme is the fallout from AI-related fears and their impact on tech and global risk sentiment. Headlines reference an "AI-led selloff" and note ongoing concerns over AI-driven disruption, coinciding with the Nasdaq Composite's -1.56% 7-day and -2.99% 30-day declines versus stronger small-cap and Dow performance. This aligns with a risk-off tilt specifically toward high-multiple tech and SaaS names, while broader risk appetite is more mixed, allowing areas like small caps and some cyclicals to outperform despite sector-specific headwinds."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The primary upcoming trigger over the next 24 hours is U.S. inflation data that investors are explicitly waiting on to refine expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, as noted in the report that U.S. index futures are muted with inflation data "on tap." This release could be market-moving: a softer print would likely support a risk-on response via lower rate expectations, while a hotter reading could reinforce the recent rise in volatility and pressure growth and tech further. No specific major earnings or policy speeches are identified in the provided data beyond this macro catalyst.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is flat, with a slight positive bias, given modest 1-day gains in the S&P 500 (+0.05%), Dow 30 (+0.10%), and Russell 2000 (+1.18%) alongside essentially flat Nasdaq futures (-0.01%). Elevated but stabilizing volatility (VIX -1.06% on the day but still high at 20.6) and lower 10Y yields support a floor under prices, while the upcoming U.S. inflation data and recent AI-led tech selloff encourage investors to stay cautious rather than extend a strong rally or deepen a selloff before the print.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether small-cap leadership persists, with the Russell 2000 around 2,646.7 and Russell futures near 2,652.5 after a +2.54% 7-day move, as continued outperformance would confirm rotation into domestic cyclicals and higher beta risk. Conversely, any renewed weakness in the Nasdaq Composite at 22,546.7 and Nasdaq futures around 24,801.25, especially if they underperform on otherwise flat index action, would signal that AI- and growth-related concerns are still dominating sector leadership.","On the macro side, the focus should remain on how the U.S. inflation release impacts the 10Y Treasury yield, now at 4.06% after a -5.12% 7-day drop, and the VIX at 20.6. A post-data move in yields back above recent levels or a renewed spike in VIX would likely translate into renewed pressure on high-multiple tech and broader risk assets, while a further drift lower in yields and VIX could validate the current stabilization in S&P futures at 6,858.5 and Dow futures at 49,623. Monitoring these rate and volatility responses around the data will be critical for gauging whether the next session skews slightly risk-on or risk-off."]
