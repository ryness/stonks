  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities finished mixed with a slight negative tilt: S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%. Breadth was marginally negative at 7 up vs 8 down with an average index change of -0.05%, signaling only tentative buying interest after a weak week where the Nasdaq is -2.55% and Russell is -3.11%. On balance, risk appetite looks fragile rather than firming.
  
  Volatility eased on the day (VIX -0.85% to 19.83) but remains elevated on a 7- and 30-day basis (+10.11% and +19.10%), indicating lingering risk aversion. Rates were a headwind intraday with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% to 4.15, while the US dollar inched higher (+0.09%), both consistent with a cautious tone.
  
  Futures point to a neutral-to-soft setup into the next session: ES -0.07%, NQ flat, YM -0.67%, and RTY +0.25%. Cross-asset signals were mixed as well, with WTI crude +2.39% and gold -2.37% on the day, suggesting rotation rather than broad-based risk-on.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is lukewarm. Breadth was slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average index change was modestly red at -0.05%, pointing to a market that is stabilizing but not broadly bid. The VIX at 19.83 is down on the day yet elevated versus the past week and month, while the 10Y Treasury yield rose to 4.15%, both consistent with ongoing caution. Together, these indicate a market that is not dislocated but remains vulnerable to downside catalysts.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up +0.13%, while the Dow lagged at -0.65%. Over the last week, small caps and tech have been the clear laggards (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq -2.55%), while the Dow held up best at -0.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Reports of global markets struggling after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy point to a risk-off macro backdrop. This aligns with the weekly drawdown in the Nasdaq (-2.53% for futures) and higher VIX on a 7- and 30-day basis, reinforcing tighter risk budgets and selective buying. US markets also faced pressure amid tech valuation concerns and economic uncertainty, which helps explain the defensive rotation and mixed breadth. The day’s small dip in the VIX and modest green prints in the Nasdaq and Russell suggest stabilization, but the broader narrative remains cautious, favoring risk-off positioning on rallies. A trade policy bright spot came as Australia welcomed the removal of US tariffs on beef and other food imports, which is incrementally risk-on for trade-sensitive cyclicals and commodities. The day’s WTI crude gain (+2.39%) is consistent with that supportive trade tone, though it has not yet translated into broad equity strength.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Mixed signals point to a sideways bias: ES is near unchanged (-0.07%) with NQ flat, breadth is slightly negative (7 up/8 down), and the VIX is down on the day but elevated over the week and month. Tech/China worries in the headlines cap upside, while modest intraday resilience (Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%) argues against a decisive downdraft absent a fresh catalyst.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch the VIX around the 20 level (last 19.83); a sustained move higher would validate risk-off and pressure equities, while a drift lower would support stabilization. Track the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.15% for rate sensitivity; further backing up in yields would likely weigh on the Dow (recent laggard at -0.65% 1d). Monitor futures pivots: ES around 6,755, NQ near 25,094, YM near 47,229, and RTY around 2,396; holding these zones would support a flat tape. Sector-wise, keep an eye on mega-cap tech given the recent sell-off narrative and small caps for confirmation of breadth (Russell 2000 +0.22% 1d but -3.11% 7d). Cross-asset tells include WTI crude at 60.09 (up 2.39% 1d), gold at 4,087.60 (down 2.37% 1d), and the US dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d); continued oil strength with a steady dollar could tighten financial conditions at the margin, reinforcing a neutral-to-cautious equity stance.

## 1. Pulse

Equities finished mixed with a slight negative tilt: S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%. Breadth was marginally negative at 7 up vs 8 down with an average index change of -0.05%, signaling only tentative buying interest after a weak week where the Nasdaq is -2.55% and Russell is -3.11%. On balance, risk appetite looks fragile rather than firming.

Volatility eased on the day (VIX -0.85% to 19.83) but remains elevated on a 7- and 30-day basis (+10.11% and +19.10%), indicating lingering risk aversion. Rates were a headwind intraday with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% to 4.15, while the US dollar inched higher (+0.09%), both consistent with a cautious tone.

Futures point to a neutral-to-soft setup into the next session: ES -0.07%, NQ flat, YM -0.67%, and RTY +0.25%. Cross-asset signals were mixed as well, with WTI crude +2.39% and gold -2.37% on the day, suggesting rotation rather than broad-based risk-on.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is lukewarm. Breadth was slightly negative (7 up, 8 down) and the average index change was modestly red at -0.05%, pointing to a market that is stabilizing but not broadly bid. The VIX at 19.83 is down on the day yet elevated versus the past week and month, while the 10Y Treasury yield rose to 4.15%, both consistent with ongoing caution. Together, these indicate a market that is not dislocated but remains vulnerable to downside catalysts.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up +0.13%, while the Dow lagged at -0.65%. Over the last week, small caps and tech have been the clear laggards (Russell 2000 -3.11%, Nasdaq -2.55%), while the Dow held up best at -0.35%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Reports of global markets struggling after a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy point to a risk-off macro backdrop. This aligns with the weekly drawdown in the Nasdaq (-2.53% for futures) and higher VIX on a 7- and 30-day basis, reinforcing tighter risk budgets and selective buying. US markets also faced pressure amid tech valuation concerns and economic uncertainty, which helps explain the defensive rotation and mixed breadth. The day’s small dip in the VIX and modest green prints in the Nasdaq and Russell suggest stabilization, but the broader narrative remains cautious, favoring risk-off positioning on rallies. A trade policy bright spot came as Australia welcomed the removal of US tariffs on beef and other food imports, which is incrementally risk-on for trade-sensitive cyclicals and commodities. The day’s WTI crude gain (+2.39%) is consistent with that supportive trade tone, though it has not yet translated into broad equity strength.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Mixed signals point to a sideways bias: ES is near unchanged (-0.07%) with NQ flat, breadth is slightly negative (7 up/8 down), and the VIX is down on the day but elevated over the week and month. Tech/China worries in the headlines cap upside, while modest intraday resilience (Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%) argues against a decisive downdraft absent a fresh catalyst.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch the VIX around the 20 level (last 19.83); a sustained move higher would validate risk-off and pressure equities, while a drift lower would support stabilization. Track the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.15% for rate sensitivity; further backing up in yields would likely weigh on the Dow (recent laggard at -0.65% 1d). Monitor futures pivots: ES around 6,755, NQ near 25,094, YM near 47,229, and RTY around 2,396; holding these zones would support a flat tape. Sector-wise, keep an eye on mega-cap tech given the recent sell-off narrative and small caps for confirmation of breadth (Russell 2000 +0.22% 1d but -3.11% 7d). Cross-asset tells include WTI crude at 60.09 (up 2.39% 1d), gold at 4,087.60 (down 2.37% 1d), and the US dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d); continued oil strength with a steady dollar could tighten financial conditions at the margin, reinforcing a neutral-to-cautious equity stance.
