  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a tentative stabilisation on the day with the S&P 500 +0.01%, Nasdaq Composite +0.17%, and Russell 2000 +0.37%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.62%, indicating a mixed risk tone rather than a broad risk-on surge. Futures echoed this split, with S&P (+0.04%), Nasdaq (+0.14%), and Russell (+0.33%) slightly higher but Dow futures -0.64%, suggesting selective buying rather than wholesale risk appetite.
  
  The weekly picture points to fading risk appetite: S&P 500 -0.85%, Nasdaq Composite -2.51%, and Russell 2000 -2.96% over 7 days. Volatility remains elevated with VIX at 20.07, up 11.44% week-over-week and 20.54% over 30 days, reinforcing a cautious backdrop despite the modest daily bounce.
  
  Rates lean restrictive at the margin with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15% (though -0.22% over 7 days), a setup that typically caps equity multiples. Cross-asset moves were mixed—WTI crude +2.15% and gold -2.26%—consistent with a choppy, position-adjustment tape rather than a clear risk-on or risk-off regime.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious but not deteriorating today: breadth is positive (11 up vs 4 down) and the average 1-day index change is a small +0.07%. However, VIX sits above 20 and is up 11.44% over the week, implying fragile risk tolerance. The 10Y yield at 4.15% rose 0.88% on the day, a headwind for valuations even as weekly rates drifted slightly lower. Net-net, the market looks stable on the surface with underlying fragility from elevated volatility and firm rates.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today tilted toward growth and small caps with the Russell 2000 +0.37% and Nasdaq Composite +0.17%, while the Dow 30 was the clear laggard at -0.62%. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed (Russell 2000 -2.96%, Nasdaq Composite -2.51%), while the Dow 30 was the relative leader at -0.31% on a weekly basis.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Headlines highlight a global tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy following Wall Street’s worst day in a month, which aligns with the Nasdaq Composite’s 7-day drop of -2.51% and the VIX’s 11.44% weekly rise; this is a clear risk-off catalyst that has pressured growth benchmarks and lifted hedging demand. Geopolitical frictions around semiconductor supply chains—China’s ‘extreme disappointment’ with a Dutch minister amid a car chip row—add to tech-sector uncertainty and multiple compression risk, consistent with the QQQ’s -2.31% and Nasdaq futures’ -2.39% moves over the week, reinforcing a cautious, risk-off bias in tech leadership.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55%: Mixed futures (ES +0.04%, NQ +0.14%, RTY +0.33% vs YM -0.64%) and a modest positive average index change today contrast with weak 7-day returns (S&P -0.85%, Nasdaq -2.51%, Russell -2.96%) and a VIX anchored at 20.07 (+11.44% w/w), while the 10Y yield rose on the day, all pointing to stabilisation with limited directional edge.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch volatility and rates as the primary signposts: VIX around 20 is a pivot—sustained closes above 20 would keep risk-off pressure, while a drift below helps stabilisation; likewise, monitor the 10Y yield near 4.15%—further upside would likely cap equity rallies while a pullback could ease pressure on multiples. Track index and futures levels for confirmation of a range-bound tape: S&P futures holding the 6,760 area (last 6,762.75) would support a flat-to-stable bias, while a break lower alongside firm VIX would skew risk lower; for leadership, watch the QQQ versus SPY and the Russell 2000 given tech’s weekly underperformance and small-cap weakness. Stay alert to headlines on China’s economy and semiconductor supply chain tensions, which have coincided with the Nasdaq’s weekly decline and broader de-risking; any escalation would likely weigh further on tech-heavy benchmarks, while an easing in rhetoric could allow a modest relief bid.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-14T20:51:23.560043+00:00">2025-11-14 20:51 UTC</time> (runtime 2m 53s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities showed a tentative stabilisation on the day with the S&P 500 +0.01%, Nasdaq Composite +0.17%, and Russell 2000 +0.37%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.62%, indicating a mixed risk tone rather than a broad risk-on surge. Futures echoed this split, with S&P (+0.04%), Nasdaq (+0.14%), and Russell (+0.33%) slightly higher but Dow futures -0.64%, suggesting selective buying rather than wholesale risk appetite.

The weekly picture points to fading risk appetite: S&P 500 -0.85%, Nasdaq Composite -2.51%, and Russell 2000 -2.96% over 7 days. Volatility remains elevated with VIX at 20.07, up 11.44% week-over-week and 20.54% over 30 days, reinforcing a cautious backdrop despite the modest daily bounce.

Rates lean restrictive at the margin with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% on the day to 4.15% (though -0.22% over 7 days), a setup that typically caps equity multiples. Cross-asset moves were mixed—WTI crude +2.15% and gold -2.26%—consistent with a choppy, position-adjustment tape rather than a clear risk-on or risk-off regime.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious but not deteriorating today: breadth is positive (11 up vs 4 down) and the average 1-day index change is a small +0.07%. However, VIX sits above 20 and is up 11.44% over the week, implying fragile risk tolerance. The 10Y yield at 4.15% rose 0.88% on the day, a headwind for valuations even as weekly rates drifted slightly lower. Net-net, the market looks stable on the surface with underlying fragility from elevated volatility and firm rates.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today tilted toward growth and small caps with the Russell 2000 +0.37% and Nasdaq Composite +0.17%, while the Dow 30 was the clear laggard at -0.62%. Over the last week, small caps and tech underperformed (Russell 2000 -2.96%, Nasdaq Composite -2.51%), while the Dow 30 was the relative leader at -0.31% on a weekly basis.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Headlines highlight a global tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy following Wall Street’s worst day in a month, which aligns with the Nasdaq Composite’s 7-day drop of -2.51% and the VIX’s 11.44% weekly rise; this is a clear risk-off catalyst that has pressured growth benchmarks and lifted hedging demand. Geopolitical frictions around semiconductor supply chains—China’s ‘extreme disappointment’ with a Dutch minister amid a car chip row—add to tech-sector uncertainty and multiple compression risk, consistent with the QQQ’s -2.31% and Nasdaq futures’ -2.39% moves over the week, reinforcing a cautious, risk-off bias in tech leadership.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55%: Mixed futures (ES +0.04%, NQ +0.14%, RTY +0.33% vs YM -0.64%) and a modest positive average index change today contrast with weak 7-day returns (S&P -0.85%, Nasdaq -2.51%, Russell -2.96%) and a VIX anchored at 20.07 (+11.44% w/w), while the 10Y yield rose on the day, all pointing to stabilisation with limited directional edge.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch volatility and rates as the primary signposts: VIX around 20 is a pivot—sustained closes above 20 would keep risk-off pressure, while a drift below helps stabilisation; likewise, monitor the 10Y yield near 4.15%—further upside would likely cap equity rallies while a pullback could ease pressure on multiples. Track index and futures levels for confirmation of a range-bound tape: S&P futures holding the 6,760 area (last 6,762.75) would support a flat-to-stable bias, while a break lower alongside firm VIX would skew risk lower; for leadership, watch the QQQ versus SPY and the Russell 2000 given tech’s weekly underperformance and small-cap weakness. Stay alert to headlines on China’s economy and semiconductor supply chain tensions, which have coincided with the Nasdaq’s weekly decline and broader de-risking; any escalation would likely weigh further on tech-heavy benchmarks, while an easing in rhetoric could allow a modest relief bid.
