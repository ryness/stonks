  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad rebound, with the S&P 500 up 0.98%, Dow 30 up 1.08%, Nasdaq Composite up 0.88%, and small caps leading as the Russell 2000 gained 2.80%. Index futures echoed the tone (ES +0.96%, NQ +0.72%, YM +1.08%, RTY +2.80%), signaling improving risk appetite on the day after a difficult week that still leaves 7-day losses at roughly 3% to 5% across majors.
  
  Volatility eased but remains elevated: VIX fell 11.32% on the day to 23.43, yet it is still up 33.81% over the past week. Rates provided a tailwind as the 10Y Treasury yield dipped 1.05% to 4.06, while commodities were mixed with gold up 0.50% and WTI crude down 1.83%; the net mix supports a modest restoration of risk appetite today against a still cautious weekly backdrop.
  
  The U.S. Dollar was little changed on the day (+0.02%) but up 0.70% on the week, consistent with last week’s risk-off tone. On balance, risk appetite is improving intraday, but cross-asset signals and the weekly drawdowns argue for guarded optimism.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health improved short term with breadth showing 12 up and 3 down and an average 1-day index gain of 1.25%, indicating broad participation. The volatility backdrop helped as VIX fell 11.32% to 23.43, though its 7-day rise of 33.81% keeps overall stress elevated. The 10Y Treasury yield at 4.06% (-1.05% 1d) provided support to equities. Overall, conditions are better today but still fragile given the week’s losses and elevated volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership favored small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 2.80% and the Dow 30 up 1.08%, while growth lagged as QQQ rose 0.75% on the day. Over the last week, tech-heavy benchmarks underperformed most (Nasdaq Fut -5.14% and QQQ -4.99%), whereas the Russell 2000 (-3.31%) and S&P 500 (-3.62%) fell relatively less, and WTI crude was a notable 1-day laggard at -1.83%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Tech and AI concentration remains a key driver, with reports highlighting an Nvidia-inspired rebound that later faltered and “tech anxiety” weighing on sentiment. This helps explain the week’s outsized declines in Nasdaq-linked benchmarks (NQ -5.14% 7d) and keeps risk-off episodes in play even as today’s bounce suggests stabilization. Policy expectations and rates are another lever, with headlines noting rate-cut bets jumping even as a Fed official warned that cutting further carries risks. The 10Y yield’s 1-day drop to 4.06% (-1.05%) aligned with today’s risk-on tone and VIX compression (-11.32% 1d), while the U.S. Dollar’s weekly rise (+0.70%) underscores lingering caution. Regional spillovers matter as Asia coverage flagged tech-led volatility and Asian FX navigating risk-off alongside lower U.S. yields. This backdrop coincides with mixed safety and growth signals (gold 1d +0.50%, 7d -3.04%; WTI 1d -1.83%), implying selective risk-on when yields ease but a quick pivot to risk-off on negative shocks.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. September jobs report, which markets are awaiting, could shift rate-cut expectations and swing equities and VIX. Japan inflation data highlighted in regional previews may influence Asia session risk tone and feed into U.S. futures.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — Today’s broad-based rebound (average index +1.25%, breadth 12 up vs 3 down), a 10Y yield dip to 4.06% (-1.05% 1d), and VIX compression (-11.32% to 23.43) point to improving risk appetite, though elevated weekly losses (about -3% to -5%) and the pending jobs report temper confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch indices and futures around their latest closes: S&P 500 at 6,602.99 and ES at 6,620.25, Russell 2000 at 2,369.59 and RTY at 2,375.30, and Nasdaq levels after a -5.14% 7-day pullback in NQ. Continued small-cap leadership after today’s +2.80% move would support an up-bias. Monitor macro signposts: 10Y Treasury yield near 4.06% (-1.05% 1d), VIX at 23.43 (-11.32% 1d), and the U.S. Dollar at 100.18 (+0.70% 7d). Further softening in yields and volatility would align with upside follow-through, while dollar firmness could cap gains. Into the Asia and U.S. sessions, track Japan inflation and the U.S. September jobs report for rate sensitivity; also watch tech versus small caps given QQQ’s lighter 1-day gain (+0.75%) versus the Russell 2000 (+2.80%). Oil at 58.06 (-1.83% 1d) and gold at 4,076.70 (+0.50% 1d) offer additional reads on growth and safety demand that could modulate equity momentum.
