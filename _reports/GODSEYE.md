  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across the equity complex, the tone is clearly risk-on, with all major U.S. benchmarks higher on the day and over the past week. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day and 2.10% over 7 days, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.82% and 2.23% over those periods, and the Dow has added 0.67% and 1.80%, respectively. Small caps are participating strongly in the near term, with the Russell 2000 up 0.82% on the day and 6.18% over the week, although it remains down 1.33% over 30 days, signaling an improving but still-recovering risk backdrop for higher-beta names.
  
  Volatility and rates are reinforcing this constructive tone. The VIX is effectively flat on the day (+0.12%) but has dropped about 30% over the week and 32% over the month to 17.21, indicating a sharp normalization in implied equity risk premia. The 10-year Treasury yield is modestly lower, down 0.10% on the day and 3.27% over the week to 4.00%, consistent with easing rate fears that support higher equity valuations and growth sectors.
  
  Equity index futures show even stronger near-term risk appetite than the cash market. S&P futures are up 1.76% on the day, Nasdaq futures are up 1.64%, Dow futures are up 2.28%, and Russell futures are leading with a 3.30% daily gain and 4.28% over the week, even though they are still slightly negative over 30 days. Taken together, rising equities, sharply lower volatility, and slightly falling long-term yields indicate that risk appetite is improving meaningfully, with investors leaning into both large-cap growth and cyclicals/small caps.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears strong based on the benchmark changes and breadth. Thirteen assets are up versus only two down, and the average index move over the last day is a solid +0.76%, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow leadership spike. The backdrop of a VIX that is roughly 30% lower over the last week and a 10-year Treasury yield that has fallen about 3.3% over the same period suggests easing macro stress. In this context, the current advance looks relatively healthy, supported by both better breadth and a friendlier volatility and rate environment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small-cap and Dow-linked futures are the clear leaders, with Russell futures up 3.30% and Dow futures up 2.28%, while in cash markets the Nasdaq Composite stands out at +0.82%. Over the week, the Russell 2000 cash index is the strongest major benchmark with a 6.18% gain, signaling a robust catch-up in riskier domestic names. On the lagging side, WTI crude is down 1.76% over the week despite a small 0.32% daily rise, and the Russell complex remains slightly negative on a 30-day view (Russell 2000 -1.33%, Russell futures -0.48%), marking small caps as a recent underperformer despite their short-term surge.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fed policy expectations and associated rate-cut optimism are the dominant macro drivers behind the current tape. Multiple headlines emphasize that stock index futures and cash equities are climbing on hopes of lower interest rates and a softer Fed stance, with references to a Fed-fueled rebound and explicit rate-cut optimism in December. This is classically risk-on: falling 10-year yields over the past week (down 3.27%) and a sharply lower VIX align with these headlines, supporting higher equity multiples and particularly benefiting growth and tech. Tech sector strength and AI-related enthusiasm are another key theme underpinning sentiment. News flow cites Alphabet’s AI rally helping to fuel a broader tech comeback and notes Nvidia’s rebound after a prior drop, while other coverage describes investors largely looking past individual tech volatility amid an across-the-board global rally. This contributes to a risk-on bias, corroborated by the Nasdaq Composite’s 0.82% daily gain and 2.23% weekly rise, along with QQQ’s 0.88% daily and 2.00% 30-day advance. Geopolitical and commodity-related developments are present but currently more of a secondary, mixed influence. Reports of ceasefire speculation between Russia and Ukraine are said to be pressuring oil, aligning with WTI crude’s 1.76% drop over the week and only modest gains over 30 days, which is mildly risk-supportive via lower energy costs but also reflects some lingering macro uncertainty. Meanwhile, gold futures are up 3.12% on the day and 3.23% on the week, suggesting a parallel bid for safety or inflation hedging even as equities rally, indicating that while the dominant tone is risk-on, some investors are still hedging macro and geopolitical tail risks.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, scheduled U.S. economic data releases highlighted in coverage—described broadly as “U.S. economic data on tap” alongside rate-cut optimism—are likely to be the main potential catalysts, with softer data likely reinforcing the current lower-yield, risk-on narrative and stronger data potentially tempering Fed-cut expectations. The holiday-shortened trading schedule around Thanksgiving, including Thursday’s full market closure and Friday’s early close, is another factor that could amplify moves due to thinner liquidity. No specific large-cap earnings or formal Fed policy meetings are cited in the provided data, so macro prints and any incremental Fed commentary referenced in “Fed-fueled rebound” headlines remain the primary near-term triggers for direction.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is up, given broad-based equity gains (average index +0.76% on the day), very strong momentum in futures (S&P +1.76%, Nasdaq +1.64%, Russell +3.30%), and a sharply lower VIX over the week that signals easing risk aversion. The 10-year yield’s decline over 7 days and the news flow focused on Fed rate-cut hopes and tech leadership further support a constructive bias. Holiday-thinned trading and elevated gold prices show some caution, but the balance of price action and catalysts tilts toward incremental upside rather than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether index futures can sustain their current gains: S&P futures around 6,839, Nasdaq futures near 25,358, Dow futures at 47,576, and Russell futures at 2,499 are all trading notably above last week’s levels. Confirmation of the cash S&P 500 holding and extending above its recent close near 6,813, alongside continued outperformance in the Russell 2000 (last 2,486, up 6.18% on the week), would align with the projected upward bias and signal that the risk-on rotation into cyclicals and small caps remains intact. Sector-wise, tech and AI-linked large caps should remain in focus given their role in recent leadership, as reflected in the Nasdaq Composite’s 0.82% daily gain and supportive headlines about an AI-fueled rebound. At the same time, monitoring gold futures (last 4,219.60, up 3.12% on the day) and WTI crude (last 59.03, slightly higher on the day but down on the week) can provide signals on any shift in risk perception or geopolitical tone that might challenge the equity uptrend. Finally, traders should track the 10-year Treasury yield around 4.00% and intraday VIX moves from 17.21; further yield slippage and contained volatility would reinforce the case for incremental equity upside in the near term.

Across the equity complex, the tone is clearly risk-on, with all major U.S. benchmarks higher on the day and over the past week. The S&P 500 is up 0.69% on the day and 2.10% over 7 days, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.82% and 2.23% over those periods, and the Dow has added 0.67% and 1.80%, respectively. Small caps are participating strongly in the near term, with the Russell 2000 up 0.82% on the day and 6.18% over the week, although it remains down 1.33% over 30 days, signaling an improving but still-recovering risk backdrop for higher-beta names.

Volatility and rates are reinforcing this constructive tone. The VIX is effectively flat on the day (+0.12%) but has dropped about 30% over the week and 32% over the month to 17.21, indicating a sharp normalization in implied equity risk premia. The 10-year Treasury yield is modestly lower, down 0.10% on the day and 3.27% over the week to 4.00%, consistent with easing rate fears that support higher equity valuations and growth sectors.

In this context, the current advance looks relatively healthy, supported by both better breadth and a friendlier volatility and rate environment.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small-cap and Dow-linked futures are the clear leaders, with Russell futures up 3.30% and Dow futures up 2.28%, while in cash markets the Nasdaq Composite stands out at +0.82%.
