  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with a tilt toward cyclicals and small caps. The S&P 500 and Dow are modestly higher on the day (+0.05% and +0.10%), while the Russell 2000 is the standout with a 1.18% gain and 6.64% advance over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite down the cap spectrum even as the Nasdaq Composite lags with a -0.22% 1d move and -2.99% over 30 days. Breadth is positive with 11 assets up versus 4 down, and the average index move is +0.23% on the day.","Volatility and rates are aligned with a constructive but not euphoric tone. The VIX is down 0.53% on the day and 5.88% over the week to 20.49, though still 41% higher over 30 days, suggesting near-term calm after a recent volatility shock. The 10Y Treasury yield has fallen 1.17% on the day and 5.12% over the week to 4.06%, consistent with the news of cooler-than-expected January CPI and easing rate fears, which has supported a return of risk appetite. Futures confirm this improvement, with S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures all up 0.31–0.42% on the session and positive over 7 days, indicating buyers are leaning in after recent equity weakness, particularly in growth and tech.Overall, risk appetite is improving in the very near term, quantified by broad advance/decline (11 up vs 4 down), positive futures across all major equity benchmarks, a softening VIX on the week, and declining 10Y yields, even as longer-horizon metrics (30d VIX +41%, Nasdaq -2.99%) highlight that the market is still normalizing from a recent risk-off phase."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately constructive. Breadth is supportive, with 11 instruments up and only 4 down, and the average 1d index change of roughly +0.23% points to a steady bid rather than a blow-off rally. The recent decline in the 10Y Treasury yield (-1.17% 1d, -5.12% 7d) and easing VIX over the last week (-5.88%) provide a macro backdrop of reduced rate and volatility pressure, which is healthy for equities. However, the still-elevated VIX versus 30 days ago (+41%) and mixed 30d equity performance (Nasdaq -2.99% vs Russell +6.64%) suggest the market is in a healing phase rather than fully robust.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is coming from cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.18% on the day and Russell futures up 0.31%, while the Dow 30 also contributes with a 0.10% 1d gain and Dow futures up 0.40%. On a 1-week view, Dow futures (+1.57%) and Russell futures (+2.88%) are leading, and the Dow cash index is essentially flat over 7 days while still up 2.99% over 30 days. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is a clear laggard with a -0.22% 1d move and -1.56% over the week, and despite QQQ being slightly positive on the day (+0.21%), it is still down 0.63% over 7 days and -2.02% over 30 days, highlighting relative weakness in large-cap tech and growth.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical tone is being shaped primarily by inflation dynamics and interest-rate expectations. The news highlights that a cooler-than-expected January CPI print (0.2% m/m vs forecasts) triggered a sharp intraday reversal from a prior sell-off driven by inflation and AI-related fears, with Treasury yields falling and risk appetite returning. This aligns closely with the observed 10Y yield decline (-5.12% over 7 days) and the broad bounce across equity futures and cash indexes, indicating this data has acted as a clear risk-on catalyst by easing concerns about further tightening.","Beyond U.S. inflation, global macro signals are mixed but not driving an outright risk-off in the provided data. Coverage of Japan and Switzerland narrowly avoiding recession and weaker UK consumer sentiment points to patchy growth outside the U.S., but there is no direct evidence in the benchmarks here of a broad de-risking tied to those headlines. Instead, the stronger performance of U.S. cyclicals and small caps (Russell 2000 up 6.64% over 30 days) alongside falling U.S. yields suggests investors are positioning for a benign domestic macro backdrop with more balanced growth and lower rate risks, moderated by lingering caution evident in still-elevated 30d VIX and strong gold performance (+16.46% over 30 days), which both temper a full-throttle risk-on interpretation."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The balance of evidence tilts modestly higher over the next 24 hours. Cash indices show a constructive but measured bid (S&P 500 +0.05%, Dow +0.10%, Russell 2000 +1.18%), and futures across S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell are all green on the latest print (+0.31% to +0.42%), signaling follow-through demand. Macro catalysts are supportive, with cooler January CPI having eased rate fears, 10Y yields trending lower over 1d and 7d, and the VIX down 5.88% over the week, all consistent with a short-term risk-on skew. However, the elevated 30d VIX and recent weakness in the Nasdaq (-2.99% over 30 days) keep conviction moderate rather than high.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should focus on whether index futures can hold and extend their current gains, particularly S&P futures around 6,879.5 and Nasdaq futures near 24,889.25, as these levels are now the immediate reference points for sustaining the nascent bounce. The Russell complex is key for confirming a risk-on rotation: Russell 2000 cash at 2,646.7 and Russell futures at 2,661.2 have been leading on both 1d and 30d horizons, so continued strength there would validate a pro-cyclical, domestic-focused bid consistent with an upward bias.","Sector-wise, monitoring tech and growth via the Nasdaq Composite (22,546.7) and QQQ (601.92) is important, as they have lagged on a 7–30 day basis while futures are now positive; stabilization or outperformance here would broaden the rally and reinforce the upside case. On the macro side, the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.06 and the VIX near 20.49 are crucial sentiment gauges—further drift lower in yields and a stable-to-softer VIX would support the projected upward move, while any sharp reversal higher in either would be an early warning that the post-CPI risk-on tone is fading."]

["Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with a tilt toward cyclicals and small caps. The S&P 500 and Dow are modestly higher on the day (+0.05% and +0.10%), while the Russell 2000 is the standout with a 1.18% gain and 6.64% advance over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite down the cap spectrum even as the Nasdaq Composite lags with a -0.22% 1d move and -2.99% over 30 days. Breadth is positive with 11 assets up versus 4 down, and the average index move is +0.23% on the day.","Volatility and rates are aligned with a constructive but not euphoric tone. The VIX is down 0.53% on the day and 5.88% over the week to 20.49, though still 41% higher over 30 days, suggesting near-term calm after a recent volatility shock. The 10Y Treasury yield has fallen 1.17% on the day and 5.12% over the week to 4.06%, consistent with the news of cooler-than-expected January CPI and easing rate fears, which has supported a return of risk appetite. Futures confirm this improvement, with S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures all up 0.31–0.42% on the session and positive over 7 days, indicating buyers are leaning in after recent equity weakness, particularly in growth and tech.Overall, risk appetite is improving in the very near term, quantified by broad advance/decline (11 up vs 4 down), positive futures across all major equity benchmarks, a softening VIX on the week, and declining 10Y yields, even as longer-horizon metrics (30d VIX +41%, Nasdaq -2.99%) highlight that the market is still normalizing from a recent risk-off phase."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately constructive. Breadth is supportive, with 11 instruments up and only 4 down, and the average 1d index change of roughly +0.23% points to a steady bid rather than a blow-off rally. The recent decline in the 10Y Treasury yield (-1.17% 1d, -5.12% 7d) and easing VIX over the last week (-5.88%) provide a macro backdrop of reduced rate and volatility pressure, which is healthy for equities. However, the still-elevated VIX versus 30 days ago (+41%) and mixed 30d equity performance (Nasdaq -2.99% vs Russell +6.64%) suggest the market is in a healing phase rather than fully robust.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is coming from cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.18% on the day and Russell futures up 0.31%, while the Dow 30 also contributes with a 0.10% 1d gain and Dow futures up 0.40%. On a 1-week view, Dow futures (+1.57%) and Russell futures (+2.88%) are leading, and the Dow cash index is essentially flat over 7 days while still up 2.99% over 30 days. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is a clear laggard with a -0.22% 1d move and -1.56% over the week, and despite QQQ being slightly positive on the day (+0.21%), it is still down 0.63% over 7 days and -2.02% over 30 days, highlighting relative weakness in large-cap tech and growth.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical tone is being shaped primarily by inflation dynamics and interest-rate expectations. The news highlights that a cooler-than-expected January CPI print (0.2% m/m vs forecasts) triggered a sharp intraday reversal from a prior sell-off driven by inflation and AI-related fears, with Treasury yields falling and risk appetite returning.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The balance of evidence tilts modestly higher over the next 24 hours. Cash indices show a constructive but measured bid (S&P 500 +0.05%, Dow +0.10%, Russell 2000 +1.18%), and futures across S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell are all green on the latest print (+0.31% to +0.42%), signaling follow-through demand. Macro catalysts are supportive, with cooler January CPI having eased rate fears, 10Y yields trending lower over 1d and 7d, and the VIX down 5.88% over the week, all consistent with a short-term risk-on skew. However, the elevated 30d VIX and recent weakness in the Nasdaq (-2.99% over 30 days) keep conviction moderate rather than high.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should focus on whether index futures can hold and extend their current gains, particularly S&P futures around 6,879.5 and Nasdaq futures near 24,889.25, as these levels are now the immediate reference points for sustaining the nascent bounce. The Russell complex is key for confirming a risk-on rotation: Russell 2000 cash at 2,646.7 and Russell futures at 2,661.2 have been leading on both 1d and 30d horizons, so continued strength there would validate a pro-cyclical, domestic-focused bid consistent with an upward bias.","Sector-wise, monitoring tech and growth via the Nasdaq Composite (22,546.7) and QQQ (601.92) is important, as they have lagged on a 7–30 day basis while futures are now positive; stabilization or outperformance here would broaden the rally and reinforce the upside case. On the macro side, the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.06 and the VIX near 20.49 are crucial sentiment gauges—further drift lower in yields and a stable-to-softer VIX would support the projected upward move, while any sharp reversal higher in either would be an early warning that the post-CPI risk-on tone is fading."]

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with a tilt toward cyclicals and small caps. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow are modestly higher on the day (+0.05% and +0.10%), while the Russell 2000 is the standout with a 1.18% gain and 6.64% advance over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite down the cap spectrum even as the Nasdaq Composite lags with a -0.22% 1d move and -2.99% over 30 days. Breadth is positive with 11 assets up versus 4 down, and the average index move is +0.23% on the day.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and rates are aligned with a constructive but not euphoric tone. The VIX is down 0.53
