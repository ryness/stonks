  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with a strong tech bid. The S&P 500 is up 0.79% on the day while the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ outperform with 1.38% and 1.45% gains, respectively, even though both remain down 2.1–2.6% over 30 days, indicating a short-term rebound within a still-corrective phase. Small caps and cyclicals are participating, with the Russell 2000 up 0.62% on the day and Russell futures up 1.10%, suggesting broader participation in today's move.","Volatility and rates are confirming an improvement in risk appetite. The VIX is down 4.26% on the day and 6.33% over 30 days to 16.87, signaling fading demand for downside protection. The 10-year Treasury yield has eased 0.84% on the day and 1.67% over the week to 4.12, which, alongside modest dollar softness over 7–30 days, supports risk assets and aligns with the 0.86% average 1-day gain across tracked equity indices.","Futures markets echo this constructive tone, led by growth-heavy contracts. S&P futures are up 1.43% and Nasdaq futures 2.23% on the day, outpacing Dow futures at +0.67%, which highlights renewed appetite for duration and tech risk despite recent AI- and tech-related selloff headlines. However, the fact that Nasdaq futures are still down about 2.0% over 30 days while Dow futures are up 1.67% shows that some rotation into more defensive or value-oriented names has persisted beneath today's bounce."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health screens as moderately positive in the very near term. Breadth is favorable with 11 instruments up versus 4 down and an average 1-day index gain of about 0.86%, showing broad participation rather than a narrow leadership spike. The VIX sliding 4.26% today to 16.87 alongside a 0.84% drop in the 10-year yield suggests a supportive volatility and rates backdrop for equities. Taken together, these point to a market that is stabilizing and leaning risk-on tactically, even though some major benchmarks remain lower on a 7–30 day basis.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, growth and tech benchmarks are leading: the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.38% and QQQ is up 1.45%, while Nasdaq futures gained 2.23%, making them clear short-term outperformers. On a weekly basis, however, those same tech-linked benchmarks are laggards, with the Nasdaq Composite down 2.42% and QQQ down 2.55% over 7 days, versus the Dow 30 up 0.82% and Dow futures up 1.29%, marking the Dow as a relative winner. A notable negative standout today is WTI crude, down 0.32% on the day and 4.27% over the week, underscoring energy as a key underperforming pocket.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical themes are centered on a rotation away from expensive tech and AI while overall equity sentiment remains resilient. Several headlines highlight tech selling and concerns about an AI bubble, with reports of the Nasdaq and other tech names having recently sold off and global investors retreating from tech in Asia, putting pressure on growth benchmarks over the last week. This selective de-risking in AI and tech is risk-off for that segment but has coincided with broader bullishness in stocks as a whole, consistent with Dow and equal-weight style outperformance and a still-elevated but positive tone in cyclicals.","Global risk appetite is also being shaped by central bank and rates expectations. News indicates the dollar is broadly firm into key central bank decisions, with markets bracing for policy moves in Britain, Europe, and Japan, while the 10-year U.S. yield has drifted lower over 7 and 30 days. This backdrop supports a risk-on tilt in U.S. equities as lower yields ease financial conditions, but the firm near-term dollar and focus on policy meetings introduce headline risk that can quickly push markets into brief risk-off phases around statements or surprises."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours include multiple central bank decisions in Britain, Europe, and Japan that markets are already bracing for, which could shift rate expectations and drive moves in global equities, FX, and rates. Traders are also closely watching a primetime address from President Trump, which could contain economic or policy signals affecting risk sentiment. In addition, earnings releases from companies like Darden Restaurants and FedEx are on deck and may influence sector tone in consumer and transport/logistics, indirectly affecting broader equity indices through guidance and demand commentary.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (average index change +0.86%), leadership from Nasdaq and QQQ, and confirming risk-on signals from a 4.26% drop in the VIX and a 0.84% decline in the 10-year yield. S&P and Nasdaq futures are already up 1.43% and 2.23%, respectively, suggesting positive momentum into the next session. However, recent 7-day weakness in tech and headline sensitivity around central bank decisions and political events temper confidence and argue for only a moderate conviction that the rally extends.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures can hold their current gains of 1.43% and 2.23% and translate them into cash-session follow-through; sustained strength there would confirm the short-term "up" bias. The VIX near 16.87 is a key tell—continued compression or a move below recent lows would validate risk-on positioning, while a sharp reversal higher would warn that the bounce is stalling despite today's higher closes. The 10-year yield at 4.12% is another important gauge; further downside would support higher-multiple tech and growth names, while a snapback in yields could repressure QQQ and the Nasdaq, which have only just rebounded from 7-day declines above 2%.","Sector-wise, focus should remain on tech and AI-linked benchmarks like the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, which led today but remain notable laggards over the past week and month, making their ability to build on 1.38–1.45% daily gains pivotal for sustaining a broader risk-on tone. At the same time, keep an eye on cyclical and small-cap proxies such as the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, both up around 0.6–1.1% today and 1.7–2.0% over 30 days, to see if participation stays broad rather than reverting back to a narrow mega-cap trade. Finally, monitor WTI crude, which is down 4.27% on the week and 6.44% over 30 days—continued weakness there could weigh on energy equities and signal lingering growth concerns even if the headline indices drift higher."]
