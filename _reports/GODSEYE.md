  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is fading. Equities were broadly lower with the S&P 500 down 0.96% on the day and the Nasdaq Composite lagging at -1.66%, while futures echoed the weakness (ES -0.98%, NQ -1.58%). Breadth was negative at 3 up vs 12 down and the average index change was -1.12%, underscoring a risk-off tilt.
  
  Volatility rose sharply as the VIX jumped 12.05% to 21.29 and is up 34.83% over the week, signaling elevated hedging demand. Rates offered only a small cushion with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.20% on the day to 4.08% but still up 2.10% over the week, while the US Dollar eased 0.21% on the day.
  
  Across assets, defensive tone showed in Gold up 1.29% on the day and 7.14% over 30 days, while WTI was marginally higher on the day (+0.29%) but remains weak over the month (-9.31%). The combination of soft equity tape, higher volatility, and only modest relief from rates points to deteriorating near-term risk appetite.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak. Breadth was poor at 3 advancers versus 12 decliners and the average index change was -1.12%, led by growth-heavy benchmarks. Volatility is elevated with VIX at 21.29 (+12.05% 1d, +34.83% 7d), while the 10Y yield dipped 0.20% on the day to 4.08% after rising 2.10% over the week, reflecting rate-path uncertainty. The mix of narrow leadership, negative breadth, and higher volatility points to a fragile tape.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed defensive: Gold Futures were a positive standout at +1.29% on the day, while the Dow 30 was relatively resilient at -0.47%. On the negative side, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.66% and QQQ dropped 1.62% on the day; over the week, Nasdaq Futures are down 5.39% versus the Dow 30 at -1.98%, marking tech as the clear laggard.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Tech and AI valuation concerns are pressuring risk assets, with multiple reports highlighting a global chip selloff and Big Tech weakness; this aligns with the Nasdaq’s 1.66% daily decline and 5.37% weekly drop, pointing to a risk-off impulse centered in growth. Such sector-led de-risking typically elevates index-level volatility, consistent with VIX rising 12.05% on the day to 21.29. Mixed labor data and debate over the Fed’s near-term path are adding uncertainty, as noted by coverage of Wall Street’s split on whether recent jobs figures imply a rebound or stall-speed for the economy. This ambiguity maps to a 10Y Treasury yield that is slightly lower on the day (-0.20%) but higher on the week (+2.10%), a pattern that helps explain persistent volatility and uneven equity sentiment even as some strategists promote dip-buying.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 65% — Broad equity weakness (S&P 500 -0.96%, Nasdaq -1.66%) with negative breadth (3 up, 12 down), futures confirming (ES -0.98%, NQ -1.58%), and a 12% jump in VIX to 21.29 indicate risk-off momentum outweighs a minor daily dip in the 10Y yield.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech and semis for follow-through: Nasdaq Futures at 24,845.75 and the Nasdaq Composite after a 1.66% drop are the risk barometers; inability to stabilize there would reinforce the weekly -5.39% drawdown. For the broader tape, monitor the S&P 500 around 6,655.64 and S&P futures at 6,681.50 for signs of buyers defending recent levels. Track volatility and rates: a VIX hold above the 21 handle keeps pressure on equities, while a further dip in the 10Y yield from 4.08% could cushion growth multiples. Dollar softness (99.52, -0.21% 1d) is a modest tailwind, but sustained risk hedging would likely dominate. Cross-asset tells: Gold near 3,998.70 holding gains would confirm defensive demand, while WTI around 59.60 with a weak 30-day profile (-9.31%) can weigh on energy sentiment. Small caps via Russell futures at 2,401.90 are key for breadth; stabilization there would help, but continued underperformance would validate a risk-off setup.
