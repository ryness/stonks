  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across major U.S. cash indices, the tone is mildly risk-off but not disorderly. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all slipped about 0.06–0.17% on the day, while the Russell 2000 bucked the trend with a 0.12% gain, and the average 1d index move was a modest -0.06%. Over 7–30 days, however, the Dow (+0.74% 7d, +3.08% 30d), S&P 500 (+0.28% 7d, +1.32% 30d), and Russell 2000 (+3.97% 7d, +6.59% 30d) remain decisively higher, indicating that risk appetite has improved over the past month even as near-term momentum stalls.","Volatility and rates are signaling a cautious backdrop rather than stress. The VIX is low in absolute terms at 15.86 and only up 0.13% on the day but has risen 3.1% over the week, suggesting a gradual rebuilding of hedging demand. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield has climbed 1.7% on the day and 4.3% over 30 days to 4.23%, a tightening impulse that tends to pressure equities and expensive growth, consistent with the slight weakness in QQQ (1d -0.08%, 7d -0.44%, 30d -0.23%).","Equity futures are notably weaker than the last cash close, pointing to fading risk appetite into the next session. S&P futures are down 0.87% on the day and 0.66% over the week, Nasdaq futures are off 1.18% on both 1d and 7d horizons, and Russell futures are down 0.97% on the day despite still being up 5.11% over 30 days. Concurrently, defensive assets like gold have surged (Gold futures +1.89% 1d, +11.0% 30d), reinforcing a short-term de-risking bias even though the broader multi-week trend remains risk-on."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is mixed to slightly negative in the very short term but still constructive on a multi-week view. Breadth is weak, with only 4 instruments up versus 11 down and the average 1d index change at about -0.06%, pointing to a soft tape. However, the key benchmarks (S&P 500, Dow, Russell 2000) are all positive over 7–30 days with gains of 0.26–6.59%, indicating the underlying trend is still up. The VIX remains low at 15.86 despite a small weekly uptick, while the 10-year yield rising to 4.23% tightens financial conditions somewhat, keeping the market in a "healthy but more cautious" zone rather than outright strong.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small caps have led while mega-cap growth has lagged: the Russell 2000 is up 0.12% versus the S&P 500 at -0.06% and the Dow at -0.17%, and QQQ, a tech-heavy proxy, is down 0.08%. On the week, the Russell 2000 is the standout leader with a 3.97% gain, while the Nasdaq Composite has slipped 0.29% and QQQ is down 0.44%, marking large-cap tech as a clear laggard. Over 30 days, the Dow (+3.08%) and Russell 2000 (+6.59%) are notable outperformers, whereas QQQ is slightly negative (-0.23%), highlighting a rotation away from prior tech leadership toward cyclicals and smaller caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and thematic drivers center on shifting perceptions of AI and growth rather than a single data print. Recent coverage notes that chip stocks rallied after TSMC's record quarter and 35% profit surge, temporarily reviving AI confidence and fueling a rebound in U.S. indices earlier in the week, a classic risk-on impulse. At the same time, separate commentary highlights economists warning about an AI-driven investment boom and the risk of another collapse, and Goldman's caution that major AI players may not fully earn back their capex, which contributes to the current cooling in QQQ and Nasdaq futures as investors temper enthusiasm.","Global sentiment is also being shaped by pockets of fragility and sectoral stress that encourage selective risk-taking. Articles on luxury retail weakness, such as the Saks bankruptcy tied to a luxury slump, and discussions about the "Magnificent 7" losing dominance point to a market that is rotating leadership and reassessing stretched segments rather than embracing broad-based risk. In parallel, strong moves in gold (up 5.07% over 7 days and 11.0% over 30 days) alongside rising global geopolitical headlines and central bank balance-sheet debates suggest a bid for safety and inflation hedges, tilting the tape slightly toward risk-off even as some regions, like India after upbeat Infosys earnings, see localized risk-on reactions."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 65% confidence. Major equity futures are materially weaker, with S&P futures down 0.87%, Nasdaq futures down 1.18%, and Dow futures down 0.75% on the day, all below their recent cash closes despite indices only slipping marginally in the last session. Breadth is negative (4 up vs 11 down) and the average 1d index move is slightly negative, while the 10-year yield has risen 1.7% on the day and over 4% in the last month to 4.23%, tightening financial conditions. The combination of softer growth/tech leadership, a bid into gold, and higher rates suggests a bias toward further modest downside rather than a rebound in the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch how S&P futures around 6,900 and Nasdaq futures near 25,400 trade relative to prior cash closes on the S&P 500 (6,940.01) and Nasdaq Composite (23,515.39), as sustained weakness below these areas would confirm follow-through on the current futures-led selloff. The behavior of the Russell complex is also key: cash Russell 2000 has been a leader (+3.97% 7d, +6.59% 30d), but Russell futures are down 0.97% on the day, so a break in small-cap momentum would signal a broader de-risking rather than just a rotation away from mega-cap tech.","On the macro side, traders should closely monitor the 10-year Treasury yield around 4.23% and the VIX near 16; further backing up in yields or a continued grind higher in volatility from current levels would support a downside bias for equities. Given the strong recent move in gold (up 1.89% 1d and 11.0% 30d), flows into or out of precious metals will also be an important tell for risk appetite, especially if combined with any AI- or chip-related headlines that could disproportionately impact Nasdaq-linked products like QQQ and NQ futures."]

LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Across major U.S. cash indices, the tone is mildly risk-off but not disorderly. The S&amp;P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all slipped about 0.06–0.17% on the day, while the Russell 2000 bucked the trend with a 0.12% gain, and the average 1d index move was a modest -0.06%. Over 7–30 days, however, the Dow (+0.74% 7d, +3.08% 30d), S&amp;P 500 (+0.28% 7d, +1.32% 30d), and Russell 2000 (+3.97% 7d, +6.59% 30d) remain decisively higher, indicating that risk appetite has improved over the past month even as near-term momentum stalls.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and rates are signaling a cautious backdrop rather than stress
