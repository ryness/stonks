  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is clearly risk-on, with all major U.S. indices up around 0.5%-0.7% on the day and 3.5%-4.2% over the past week, while the Russell 2000 has surged 6.46% over 7 days. ETFs echo this strength, with SPY up 0.55% on the day and 3.53% on the week and QQQ up 0.81% and 3.85% over the same horizons, indicating broad and growth-led participation. The average 1d index change of roughly 0.62% and 12 advances versus 3 declines in the breadth data underscore improving risk appetite.
  
  Volatility and rates are reinforcing this constructive tone: the VIX is down 4.89% on the day and almost 34% over the week to 16.35, signaling a sharp easing in hedging demand as equities rally. The 10Y Treasury yield is modestly higher on the day (+0.48%) but lower by 2.57% over the week, suggesting recent relief on the rates front that aligns with the prevailing Fed rate-cut optimism noted in headlines. This combination of rising stocks, falling volatility, and a net softer yield backdrop points to a solid risk-on re-rating rather than a defensive bid.
  
  Equity futures are even more bullish than cash, with S&P futures up 2.06%, Nasdaq futures up 2.14%, Dow futures up 2.64%, and Russell futures up 3.57% on the day, indicating investors are willing to extend exposure into the next session. Commodities and FX show a nuanced mix: gold futures are up 3.09% on the day and 3.20% over the week, oil is modestly softer (WTI -0.49% on the day, -2.56% on the week), and the U.S. dollar is marginally lower over 1-7 days, a profile consistent with a blend of risk-on equity appetite and ongoing demand for traditional havens like gold.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark changes and breadth. Twelve of fifteen tracked assets are higher on the day, with an average index gain of about 0.62%, and every major equity benchmark is up more than 3% over the past week. Volatility has compressed sharply, with the VIX down nearly 34% over seven days to 16.35, while the 10Y yield has edged lower on the week despite a small uptick today, indicating that rate pressures have eased somewhat. Together, this points to a resilient, risk-supportive environment rather than a stressed or defensive tape.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, small caps and tech have led: Russell 2000 cash is up 0.58% and Russell futures are up 3.57%, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.65% and QQQ is up 0.81%. On a one-week basis, the Russell 2000 is the clear standout, gaining 6.46%, followed by the Nasdaq Composite at 4.16%. On the downside, energy is lagging, with WTI crude off 0.49% on the day and down 2.56% over the week, making it a notable underperformer versus the rest of the risk complex.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fed policy expectations and rate-cut optimism are a primary macro driver, as highlighted by headlines noting that stock index futures are gaining on Fed rate-cut hopes and that weaker job growth and lower inflation are lining up for a potential December cut. This easier-policy narrative aligns with the 2.57% weekly decline in the 10Y Treasury yield and the broad 3%-4% weekly gains in U.S. indices, supporting a risk-on bias as lower discount-rate expectations boost equity valuations and growth-sensitive sectors. Global equity sentiment is also being buoyed by a broad-based rally and winning streak in major markets, with reports of Wall Street logging a four-day run of gains and global indexes erasing most earlier November losses. Articles noting that investors are ignoring idiosyncratic tech weakness in names like Nvidia in favor of an across-the-board rally underscore that the tape is being driven by macro risk appetite rather than single-stock stories, which fits with strong breadth and leadership from both large-cap and small-cap benchmarks. A secondary theme is the contrast between traditional safe havens and newer ones, as coverage points out that gold is rising while Bitcoin has been under pressure, challenging the crypto safe-haven narrative. In the current data, gold futures are up 3.09% on the day and 3.20% over the week, moving higher alongside equities, which suggests investors are simultaneously embracing risk assets and adding some insurance against macro uncertainty, rather than rotating aggressively into defensive positioning.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Upcoming triggers over the next 24 hours are centered on U.S. macro data and Fed-related rate-cut expectations referenced in headlines about economic data being "on tap" and weaker jobs and inflation supporting a cut in December. Specific reports are not enumerated in the data, but the context implies that scheduled U.S. economic releases tied to labor and inflation, along with any fresh Fed commentary, could shift rate-cut odds and therefore equity and futures pricing. In addition, global sessions following the U.S. Thanksgiving closure, as referenced in coverage of world and Asia-Pacific markets tracking Wall Street's streak, may amplify moves in U.S. futures as liquidity and participation normalize.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 70% confidence – The bias is higher given that all major U.S. equity indices are up around 0.5%-0.7% on the day and 3.5%-6.5% over the week, futures are substantially stronger with gains of 2.06%-3.57% across S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts, and the VIX has fallen nearly 5% on the day and 34% over the week. This constructive price action is supported by macro headlines highlighting Fed rate-cut optimism and a global equity rally that has erased most recent losses, while the 10Y yield is lower on the week, reducing immediate rate headwinds. Together, these signals point to a market inclined to extend the recent risk-on move absent a negative surprise from the upcoming U.S. data flow.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures can hold or build on their strong gains, with ES already up 2.06% at 6,859.5 and NQ up 2.14% at 25,482. Sustained strength here would confirm follow-through on the cash indices, which are sitting near recent highs after multi-day advances of roughly 3.5%-4.2%, while any sharp intraday reversal in futures would be an early warning that profit-taking is emerging after the rally. Small caps and volatility are key tells for the quality of the risk-on move: Russell futures are up 3.57% on the day and 4.55% over the week, so holding above the 2,500 area in RTY and Russell 2000 cash would signal continued breadth and risk tolerance. At the same time, the VIX near 16.35 after a 33%-plus weekly slide should be monitored for any abrupt spike higher, which, alongside a rebound in the 10Y yield from roughly 4.02%, would indicate that Fed rate-cut optimism is being questioned by incoming data. On the macro side, watch the reaction of gold, WTI, and the U.S. dollar to the next round of U.S. economic releases tied to growth and inflation that headlines flag as important for rate expectations. Gold futures, already up 3.09% on the day and 3.20% over the week, could extend higher if data reinforce the rate-cut narrative or signal lingering macro risks, while soft WTI prices and a slightly weaker dollar over 1-7 days suggest that any surprise towards stronger growth or tighter policy could reverse some of the current cross-asset configuration and challenge the upward equity bias.

Commodities and FX show a nuanced mix: gold futures are up 3.09% on the day and 3.20% over the week, oil is modestly softer (WTI -0.49% on the day, -2.56% on the week), and the U.S. dollar is marginally lower over 1-7 days, a profile consistent with a blend of risk-on equity appetite and ongoing demand for traditional havens like gold.

Twelve of fifteen tracked assets are higher on the day, with an average index gain of about 0.62%, and every major equity benchmark is up more than 3% over the past week.
