  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Risk appetite is improving across most risk assets, with equities, futures, and volatility metrics all pointing to a constructive tone. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are up 0.25%, 0.39%, and 0.59% on the day, respectively, while QQQ leads with a 0.78% gain and SPY adds 0.19%. Over the past week, large caps and growth have rallied strongly (S&P 500 and SPY +4.44%, Nasdaq +6.05%, QQQ +6.20%), indicating a pronounced risk-on shift.","Volatility and rates are reinforcing this risk-on backdrop. The VIX is down 3.77% on the day and a steep 37.21% over the week to 16.59, showing a sharp reset lower in implied equity risk premia. The 10Y Treasury yield is marginally lower on the day (-0.24%) and over the week (-0.49%), suggesting slightly easier financial conditions even though it remains about 2.5% higher over 30 days, a combination that supports equities while limiting fears of an abrupt rates shock.","Futures are even more bullish than cash indices, hinting at positive follow-through. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are up 1.90%, 2.74%, 2.35%, and 2.27% on the day, respectively, outpacing spot moves and pointing to strengthening intraday risk appetite. The one notable wrinkle is small caps: the Russell 2000 cash index is modestly negative on the day (-0.17%) and down 1.40% over 30 days, even as Russell futures bounce, highlighting lingering skepticism toward the highest-beta domestic names despite the broader risk-on tone."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is constructive, with 10 assets up versus 5 down and an average 1-day index change of about +0.34%, indicating gains are reasonably broad-based rather than narrowly driven. The sharp drop in the VIX over the week (-37.21% to 16.59) alongside a slightly softer 10Y yield over the last 7 days (-0.49%) suggests a calming macro backdrop and supportive risk environment. While the 10Y is still up 2.51% over 30 days, equities have absorbed that move well, pointing to a generally healthy market with improving sentiment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day and week is clearly in large-cap growth and tech-linked benchmarks, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.59% on the day and 6.05% over the week and QQQ up 0.78% on the day and 6.20% over the week. The Russell 2000 is the main laggard, down 0.17% on the day and still negative over 30 days (-1.40%) despite a strong 7-day rebound of 6.94%. Among futures, Nasdaq futures are a standout with a 1-day jump of 2.74%, while Russell futures' 1-day gain of 2.27% contrasts with the weaker small-cap cash index, underscoring that leadership remains skewed toward large-cap growth rather than broad small-cap participation.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and cross-asset themes are mixed but skewing back toward risk-on after an earlier risk-off shock. Several headlines highlight a deepening crypto rout, including Bitcoin plunging and crypto-focused ETFs and stocks seeing outsized drawdowns, which had weighed on equities in recent sessions as part of a broader flight from risk. At the same time, gold is rallying strongly (gold futures +3.84% on the day and +3.95% on the week), a classic sign of residual caution, yet the rebound in equity indices and futures suggests investors are differentiating between crypto-specific stress and broader equity risk, tempering the risk-off impulse.","Monetary policy and global macro positioning are another key driver of the tape. News flow around a potential Bank of Japan policy shift and speculation about future Fed cuts, alongside commentary about weaker US labor markets and lower inflation, has fed into modestly lower Treasury yields over the last week (10Y -0.49%) and a slightly softer dollar over 7 days (-0.91%). This combination typically supports a risk-on bias in equities and growth assets, which fits with the strong 7-day performance in US indices and futures despite bouts of volatility tied to crypto and data-center-related trading outages."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete upcoming triggers within the next 24 hours are not specified in the provided data, so the key near-term movers are likely to remain macro sentiment around the ongoing crypto selloff, perceptions of central bank policy paths, and any follow-up to the recent CME futures outage; however, specific scheduled earnings, economic data releases, or policy meetings are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence – The most likely market direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given the strong positive momentum in major cash indices over the past week (S&P 500 +4.44%, Nasdaq +6.05%, Dow +3.76%) and the particularly bullish tone in equity futures today (S&P +1.90%, Nasdaq +2.74%, Dow +2.35%, Russell +2.27%). The sharp collapse in the VIX over the last week (-37.21%) alongside slightly lower 10Y yields over 7 days supports a risk-on environment and suggests pullbacks are being bought. While the crypto rout and gold strength signal underlying caution, the current pattern of futures outperforming spot and broad positive breadth (10 up vs 5 down) argues for a constructive bias rather than renewed downside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether equity futures can sustain their outperformance versus cash, particularly S&P futures around the 6,848.75 area and Nasdaq futures near 25,630.75, as continued strength there would confirm the expected upside in the next session. Close attention should be paid to the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, which are leading on both 1-day and 7-day horizons; any reversal in these growth benchmarks would be an early signal that the current risk-on follow-through is stalling.","Given the mixed signals across size segments, monitoring the Russell 2000 cash index around 2,465 and Russell futures near 2,474 will be important to see if small caps can convert today's strong futures rebound (+2.27%) into actual cash strength. On the macro side, keep an eye on the VIX holding near or below the mid-teens and the 10Y yield around 4.09: continued stability or further softening there would corroborate the constructive equity bias, while any abrupt spike in either could signal a quick shift back toward risk-off, especially with ongoing stress in crypto and elevated gold prices."]
