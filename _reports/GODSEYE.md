  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are firmly risk-on today, with all four major US indices higher: the S&P 500 up 0.88%, Nasdaq Composite up 1.31%, Dow up 0.38%, and Russell 2000 up 0.86%. ETFs echo this tone, with SPY up 0.91% and QQQ up 1.30%, while breadth is very strong at 13 advancers versus 2 decliners across the monitored complex. Despite these gains, the 7d tape remains slightly negative for growth benchmarks (S&P 500 -0.76%, Nasdaq -1.46%, QQQ -1.68%), suggesting today is more of a sharp rebound within a choppy week than a clean breakout trend.","Volatility and rates are aligned with improving risk appetite. The VIX has collapsed 11.6% on the day and nearly 12% over the week to 14.9, reinforcing a calm, risk-seeking backdrop. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15% but is roughly flat over the week (-0.31%), indicating that modest rate backing-up is not yet pressuring equities. Index futures are positive but less emphatic than cash (ES +0.27%, NQ +0.42%, YM +0.21%, RTY flat to -0.02%), signaling risk appetite is improving in the very near term but still constrained by the recent 7d drawdowns in S&P and Nasdaq futures (-1.38% and -2.58%, respectively)."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly constructive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average index change over 1d is approximately +0.94%, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow mega-cap move. The sharp 11.6% drop in VIX to 14.9 shows stress is receding, while the 10Y yield edging up to 4.15% but being little changed over 7d suggests rates are not meaningfully tightening financial conditions. Overall, conditions resemble a healthy, low-volatility, late-week risk-on environment after a modest prior pullback.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in large-cap growth and tech, with the Nasdaq Composite up 1.31% and QQQ up 1.30% standing out as the strongest major benchmarks, while the S&P 500 also posts a robust 0.88% gain. On the lagging side today, the Russell 2000 future (RTY=F) is essentially flat at -0.02%, underperforming the cash Russell's +0.86% and trailing the big-cap indices' gains. Over the past week, however, the Nasdaq complex has lagged materially (Nasdaq Composite -1.46%, Nasdaq futures -2.58%, QQQ -1.68%), while the Dow has quietly led on a relative basis with a 7d gain of 0.16%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical drivers are tilting risk-on, led by a tech-driven rebound and supportive year-end seasonality narratives. Headlines highlight US equities "gaining massively" with the Nasdaq, Dow, and S&P rising as Nvidia and Oracle lift tech stocks, matching the observed 1.03–1.31% Nasdaq strength intraday and 1.31% close-to-close gain. This tech leadership meshes with commentary about an AI-related bifurcation in SaaS, where winners like Palantir and Cloudflare have surged, reinforcing a risk-on bias toward AI beneficiaries even as weaker B2B names lag, which helps explain why QQQ (+1.30% 1d) is outperforming broader indices.","Another key macro theme is global central-bank policy, particularly the Bank of Japan's rate hike, which has pushed bond yields higher but has not derailed equities. News notes that US stocks are "ticking higher as yields rise after BOJ hike," and S&P futures are up 0.27% even as the US 10Y yield rises 0.85% on the day to 4.15%, indicating markets currently interpret the move as orderly normalization rather than a risk-off shock. BOJ tightening has also lifted Asian risk appetite and crypto prices, which aligns with the cross-asset tone of modestly higher yields, firmer dollar (+0.17% 1d), and still-strong gold (+0.50% 1d, +9.59% 30d), suggesting a nuanced but net risk-on environment where investors are comfortable adding equity risk while keeping hedges in hard assets."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** In the next 24 hours, traders will be watching corporate earnings from names like FedEx and Darden Restaurants, which are scheduled to report tomorrow and could influence sentiment around consumer demand, logistics, and services spending. Any additional commentary around the Bank of Japan's recent rate hike and its spillover into global bond yields will also be in focus, as higher yields could temper the current equity bid if they accelerate. More broadly, markets will monitor scheduled US data and jobs-related signals referenced in recent coverage, as labor and growth surprises could shift expectations for central-bank paths and thereby impact both rates and equity risk appetite.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%), very strong breadth (13 up, 2 down), and a sharply lower VIX (-11.6% to 14.9) that signals easing risk premia. While 7d returns are still slightly negative for the S&P and Nasdaq, suggesting an ongoing choppy range, the positive close in index futures (ES +0.27%, NQ +0.42%, YM +0.21%) alongside supportive macro narratives around tech leadership and contained rates (10Y roughly flat over 7d) tilt the near-term bias toward incremental upside rather than a reversal. Confidence is tempered because the week's prior drawdowns and modest uptick in yields could quickly cap rallies if new data disappoints.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures can hold and extend today's gains, with ES and NQ needing to build on their current 1d advances of 0.27% and 0.42% to validate an "up" bias. Given tech's leadership (Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, QQQ +1.30%), relative performance of large-cap growth and AI-linked names versus cyclicals will be key; sustained outperformance would reinforce the narrative of a tech-led year-end grind higher, while any abrupt rotation into value or small caps, especially with Russell futures currently flat to slightly negative, could signal fatigue in the tech trade.","Rates, volatility, and key earnings prints are also important signposts for sustaining the upside bias. The 10Y Treasury yield at 4.15% has risen 0.85% on the day but is essentially unchanged over the week, so equity bulls will want to see yields stabilize rather than spike further, which could reprice growth and compress valuations. With VIX already down to 14.9 after a 17.2% slide over 30d, any reversal higher in volatility around upcoming earnings (e.g., FedEx, Darden) or fresh macro headlines tied to the BOJ hike or US data would be an early warning that today's risk-on tone is fading."]

["Equities are firmly risk-on today, with all four major US indices higher: the S&P 500 up 0.88%, Nasdaq Composite up 1.31%, Dow up 0.38%, and Russell 2000 up 0.86%.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%), very strong breadth (13 up, 2 down), and a sharply lower VIX (-11.6% to 14.9) that signals easing risk premia.

Confidence is tempered because the week's prior drawdowns and modest uptick in yields could quickly cap rallies if new data disappoints.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures can hold and extend today's gains, with ES and NQ needing to build on their current 1d advances of 0.27% and 0.42% to validate an "up" bias.
