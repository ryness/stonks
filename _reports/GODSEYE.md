  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are in a clear risk-on mode, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day and average index gains around 0.85%. The S&P 500 is up 0.62% on the day and 6.21% over 30 days, while the Dow has gained 0.99% today and 8.11% over the month, and the Russell 2000 is outperforming with a 1.37% daily rise and 12.05% over 30 days. Even with the Nasdaq slightly negative over 7 days (-0.28%), its 0.65% daily gain and 6.65% 30-day rise confirm that risk appetite remains firm rather than fading.","Volatility and futures confirm the constructive tone, though with some nuance. The VIX is low at 14.75 and down 1.0% on the day and 44% over 30 days, signaling subdued equity stress despite a 9.5% uptick over the last week. S&P futures are up 0.64% on the day and nearly 6.6% over 30 days, Dow futures are up 1.07% on the day and 8.58% over 30 days, and Russell futures are up 1.37% on the day and 12.42% over 30 days, indicating strong forward risk appetite.","Rates and cross-asset signals are moderately risk-on but not euphoric. The 10-year Treasury yield has edged up only modestly (about 0.34% on the day, 1.78% over 30 days) to 4.18%, suggesting higher but stable yields that have not derailed equities. Gold is strong (+0.91% 1d and +10.37% 30d), pointing to some demand for hedges, while WTI crude is weak (-3.33% 1d and -4.67% 30d), and the US dollar is slightly firmer on the week but down over 30 days, together implying that risk appetite is improving overall but still coexists with selective defensive positioning."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears strong based on the benchmark changes and breadth. Breadth is robust, with 13 instruments up versus only 2 down, and the average 1-day index gain of about 0.85% shows coordinated strength across major benchmarks. The VIX at 14.75, down sharply over 30 days, points to a low-volatility backdrop, and the modest 10Y yield rise to 4.18% indicates that higher rates are not yet pressuring risk assets. Taken together, this combination of broad equity gains, contained volatility, and only gradual rate drift suggests a healthy market environment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is coming from cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.37% and Dow 30 up 0.99% on the day, and Russell futures similarly gaining 1.37%. Over the past week the Dow 30 stands out positively with a 1.50% rise, while the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ ETF are laggards at -0.28% and -0.08% over 7 days, respectively, despite their solid 1-day rebounds of 0.65% and 0.88%. On the downside, WTI crude is a clear negative standout with a 1-day drop of 3.33%, contrasting with the broader equity strength.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The tape is being driven in part by geopolitical developments around Venezuela, where a U.S. military strike captured President Nicolás Maduro. News flow indicates that major stock indexes and energy shares initially jumped as investors largely downplayed broader market ramifications, which aligns with today's nearly 1% move in U.S. equities and strength in energy-related stocks cited in the headlines. This dynamic supports a risk-on bias as markets perceive the event as contained rather than systemic.","Macro sentiment is also supported by a backdrop of resilient growth narratives and targeted policy actions. Articles referencing strong U.S. GDP growth earlier and expectations of increased capital expenditure in India ahead of the Union Budget point to ongoing confidence in economic activity, which is consistent with the 6–8% 30-day gains across the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq futures. Such growth-linked themes tend to reinforce risk-on behavior in equities while keeping volatility like the VIX compressed.","In emerging markets, currency and bond developments are adding localized risk but have not spilled over meaningfully into core U.S. assets. The Indian rupee's depreciation against the dollar amid a delayed U.S. trade deal and reduced foreign investment contrasts with Exim Bank's ability to raise $1 billion at record-low spreads, painting a mixed but not crisis-level picture. These factors, combined with a slightly firmer U.S. dollar and rising gold prices, suggest some regional risk-off pockets, but the dominant impact on the global tape remains supportive for risk assets overall given strong U.S. equity performance."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term triggers referenced in the data include the upcoming release of Federal Reserve FOMC meeting minutes cited by Barchart, which could shift expectations around the path of rates and thus equity valuations. Any additional headlines or clarifications around the U.S. actions in Venezuela, as highlighted by multiple sources, could move energy, defense, and broader risk sentiment if the situation escalates or de-escalates. In India, pre-Budget capital expenditure expectations and ongoing commentary around trade deal delays may influence local risk sentiment and EM flows, though the direct impact on U.S. benchmarks in the next 24 hours appears limited based on current information.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity strength today (average index gain ~0.85%) and strong 30-day uptrends across the S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq, and Russell. Volatility remains low with the VIX at 14.75 and down sharply over 30 days, while the 10Y yield's gradual rise has not impeded risk taking. Geopolitical news around Venezuela is currently being downplayed by investors per the headlines, which, together with supportive macro narratives, favors a continued risk-on bias barring any surprise from upcoming Fed-related commentary.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should monitor whether small caps and cyclicals can sustain leadership, with the Russell 2000 and Russell futures already up about 1.37% on the day and over 12% on the month. Watching the S&P 500 region around its recent close near 6,945 and S&P futures near 6,988 as reference pivots will help gauge whether buy-the-dip behavior persists and confirms the prevailing uptrend. Continued compression in the VIX around the mid-teens would corroborate the bias toward higher equities.","Macro-wise, attention should focus on any Fed-related releases such as the FOMC minutes, as these could influence the 10Y yield near 4.18% and, in turn, equity multiples. Sector-wise, energy should be watched closely given the divergence between weaker WTI crude (down 3.33% on the day) and supportive headlines for energy shares, while gold's strength (+10.37% over 30 days) and the slightly firmer dollar over 7 days may signal how much defensive positioning coexists with the current risk-on tone. Any shift in these cross-asset relationships could challenge or reinforce the expected upward bias in equities over the next 24 hours."]

["Equities are in a clear risk-on mode, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day and average index gains around 0.85%.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity strength today (average index gain ~0.85%) and strong 30-day uptrends across the S&P 500, Dow, Nasdaq, and Russell. Volatility remains low with the VIX at 14.75 and down sharply over 30 days, while the 10Y yield's gradual rise has not impeded risk taking.

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Equities are in a clear risk-on mode, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day and average index gains around 0.85%. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.62% on the day and 6.21% over 30 days, while the Dow has gained 0.99% today and 8.11% over the month, and the Russell 2000 is outperforming with a 1.37% daily rise and 12.05% over 30 days. Even with the Nasdaq slightly negative over 7 days (-0.28%), its 0.65% daily gain and 6.65% 30-day rise confirm that risk appetite remains firm rather than fading.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and futures confirm the constructive tone, though with some nuance. The VIX is low
