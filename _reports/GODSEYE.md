  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-14T10:27:13.615305+00:00">2025-11-14 10:27 UTC</time> (runtime 2m 25s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities sold off broadly, with the S&P 500 down 1.66% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite down 2.29%, the Russell 2000 down 2.77%, and the Dow 30 down 1.65%. Breadth was weak (4 up, 11 down) and the average index change was -2.01% across the basket, signaling fading risk appetite.
  
  Volatility firmed as the VIX rose 6.05% to 21.21 on the day and is up 17.77% over a week, consistent with a de-risking backdrop. Equity futures are soft into the next session (S&P -0.21%, Nasdaq -0.47%, Dow -0.13%, Russell -0.19% on 1d), reinforcing a cautious tone rather than a rebound.
  
  Rates edged higher with the 10Y Treasury yield up 1.16% to 4.11, while cross-asset signals were mixed: WTI crude gained 2.47% on the day, gold slipped 0.44% but is up 7.41% over 30 days, and the US Dollar ticked up 0.13% on the day. The combination of higher yields and elevated volatility points to deteriorating risk appetite despite isolated strength in energy.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks fragile after a broad 1d drawdown with average index change -2.01% and only 4 advancers versus 11 decliners. Elevated implied volatility (VIX 21.21, +6.05% 1d) and a 10Y yield at 4.11 (+1.16% 1d) frame tighter financial conditions. While the Dow remains up 0.79% over 7d, small caps are weak and the Nasdaq fell 2.29% today, keeping leadership narrow. This mix points to a risk-off tape with limited cushioning from rates or volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, energy led on price action with WTI crude up 2.47%, while small caps lagged as the Russell 2000 fell 2.77% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.29%. Over the past week, the Dow 30 is a relative leader at +0.79% while the Nasdaq Composite (-2.05%) and Russell 2000 (-1.83%) lag. Positive standout (1d): WTI crude +2.47%; negative standout (1d): Russell 2000 -2.77%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Headlines around a potential end to/reopening after the U.S. government shutdown supported futures midweek (CNBC, AP, ABC, Times of India noted gains on shutdown optimism), a risk-on impulse that briefly lifted markets. However, with today’s broad equity declines and softer overnight futures, that boost appears to have faded for now, tempering the risk-on narrative. Rotation and cooling in the AI/tech trade were highlighted in coverage noting futures dipping as the AI rally cooled and AMD-related optimism gave way to consolidation (Times of India). This aligns with the Nasdaq Composite’s 1d -2.29% and Nasdaq futures’ 7d -2.99%, skewing the tape risk-off for growth exposures. Energy news flagged firmer oil on shutdown hopes and fuel strength (Rigzone/Yahoo), and WTI crude rose 2.47% on the day. While supportive for energy equities, higher oil alongside higher yields can be a headwind for broader risk, keeping the overall tone mixed to risk-off.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% — Broad 1d equity declines (S&P -1.66%, Nasdaq -2.29%, Russell -2.77%), higher VIX at 21.21 (+6.05% 1d), and a 10Y yield up to 4.11 (+1.16% 1d) point to de-risking, while equity futures remain soft (ES -0.21%, NQ -0.47%). Shutdown-related optimism in headlines has not translated into sustained bids, keeping near-term bias lower.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Monitor VIX holding above 20 (last 21.21) and the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.11; persistence here would likely pressure growth benchmarks like the Nasdaq (cash -2.29% today) and QQQ (-2.04% 1d). Watch ES 6,745.75 (-0.21% 1d) and NQ 24,976.25 (-0.47% 1d) for continuation or stabilization into the open. Track small caps for risk sentiment: Russell 2000 cash at 2,382.98 (-2.77% 1d) and RTY futures at 2,385.40 (-0.19% 1d; -3.55% 7d). Continued underperformance alongside weak breadth (4 up, 11 down) would reinforce a risk-off tape. Watch cross-asset cues: WTI crude at 60.14 (+2.47% 1d) for energy leadership, gold at 4,168.50 (-0.44% 1d; +4.73% 7d) as a haven gauge, and the US Dollar at 99.30 (+0.13% 1d). Stay alert to headlines on U.S. government reopening noted by AP, ABC, and CNBC, which have been market-sensitive.
