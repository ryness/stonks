  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities were mixed into the last close with the S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow 30 -0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%, while the average index change was a modest -0.05% and breadth skewed positive (10 up, 5 down). This reflects a cautious but selective risk appetite, with tech and small caps stabilizing on the day even as the Dow lagged.
  
  Volatility remains elevated: VIX sits at 19.83, down 0.85% on the day but up 10.1% week-over-week and 19.1% over 30 days, signaling a still-firm risk premium despite a 1-day ease. Rates firmed as the 10Y yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15% (though -0.22% over the week), a headwind for equity multiples that aligns with the softer S&P performance.
  
  Futures point to tentative risk-on into the next session: S&P +0.35%, Nasdaq +0.61%, Russell +0.23%, and Dow +0.03%. That said, small caps remain the weekly underperformer (Russell 2000 -3.11% and Russell futures -1.07% 7d), indicating risk appetite has faded over the week even if near-term tone is improving.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is neutral-to-fragile: the average index change was -0.05% despite positive breadth (10 up vs 5 down), signaling uneven participation. Volatility is still elevated with VIX at 19.83 and up 10.1% over the week and 19.1% over 30 days, keeping a higher risk premium in place even after a small 1-day dip. The 10Y yield rose 0.88% on the day to 4.15%, a near-term drag on valuations, although it’s little changed over the week (-0.22%). Overall, selective strength is offset by firmer rates and higher vol, pointing to a guarded backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, the Russell 2000 led at +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite gained +0.13%, while the Dow 30 was the laggard at -0.65%. Over the week, small caps were the clear underperformers (Russell 2000 -3.11%) alongside the Nasdaq Composite (-2.55%), whereas the Dow 30 was comparatively resilient at -0.35%. Defensively, Gold Futures outperformed on the week at +2.76%, highlighting rotation into havens.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy and a “data fog” following the U.S. government shutdown are front and center, with multiple reports noting investors paring near-term rate-cut bets and global equities wobbling. This has supported a risk-off tone over the week, consistent with the VIX rising 10.1% 7d and the 10Y yield firming on the day, both of which typically pressure equity valuations. AI valuation concerns and event risk around Nvidia’s pending results are key sector drivers, with coverage highlighting skittishness in tech and reliance on Nvidia as the next cue. This aligns with the week’s tech underperformance (Nasdaq Composite -2.55% and QQQ -2.31% 7d), reinforcing a cautious bias toward growth exposures until earnings clarity reduces uncertainty.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings (flagged as the next key cue for AI and broader tech) could swing index volatility and leadership; no other specific scheduled data or policy events were identified in the provided news for the next 24 hours.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 55% – Equity futures are modestly higher (ES +0.35%, NQ +0.61%, RTY +0.23%) and breadth was positive (10 up, 5 down) with VIX easing on the day (-0.85%), suggesting a tentative risk-on tone into the next session, though elevated VIX on a 7–30 day basis and a firmer 10Y yield temper confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures levels for confirmation: ES holding above its prior 1-day reference near 6755 and NQ above ~25094 would support an upward bias, while a VIX push back above the 20 handle would undercut risk sentiment. Small caps via RTY (~2396 reference, 2401.5 last) are a tell; stabilization there would broaden any rally. Monitor tech/AI leadership into Nvidia’s results via QQQ (last 608.86) and the Nasdaq Composite (last 22,900.59) given their weak 7d prints, and track the 10Y yield around 4.15 as a cap on multiple expansion. On cash indices, Dow 30 underperformance (-0.65% 1d) versus the Russell/Nasdaq bounce is notable; sustained divergence or reversal will shape the session’s breadth and momentum.
