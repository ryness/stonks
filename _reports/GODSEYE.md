  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are trading with a constructive tone, with the S&P 500 up 0.42% on the day and 1.18% over the week, and the Nasdaq Composite stronger at +0.54% 1d and +1.55% 7d. Large-cap ETFs echo this risk-on bias (SPY +0.45% 1d, QQQ +0.43% 1d), while small caps are the main soft spot, with the Russell 2000 down 0.55% on the day and slightly negative over the week despite a solid +3.63% over 30 days. Overall, risk appetite is improving but uneven, with investors favoring large-cap growth and tech over domestic small caps.","Volatility and futures pricing further confirm an improving risk appetite. The VIX is depressed at 13.85, down 1.63% on the day, 12.0% over the week, and more than 21% over 30 days, indicating declining demand for protection. S&P and Nasdaq futures are higher (ES +0.44% 1d, +1.91% 7d; NQ +0.42% 1d, +2.33% 7d), suggesting markets are leaning into the rally, while Dow futures lag modestly and Russell futures are negative on the day (-0.40%), underscoring a quality/mega-cap tilt rather than broad speculative risk-taking.","Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive. The 10Y Treasury yield is essentially flat on the day and down 0.60% over the week at 4.17%, implying no acute rates shock, while the US Dollar index is softer over 1d, 7d, and 30d (down 0.34%, 0.46%, and 1.67% respectively), which typically eases financial conditions. At the same time, Gold futures are bid strongly (+1.72% 1d, +5.14% 7d, +9.95% 30d), pointing to some ongoing demand for hedges, but the combination of rising equities, lower volatility, stable rates, and a weaker dollar indicates that, on balance, risk appetite is improving rather than fading."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears moderately strong based on the benchmark moves. Breadth is positive, with 10 assets up versus 5 down and an average 1-day index gain of about 0.30%, showing more constituents participating on the upside than declining. The low and falling VIX at 13.85, combined with a stable-to-slightly lower 10Y yield over the week, suggests a calm macro backdrop without immediate stress from rates or volatility. Taken together, this points to a healthy but not euphoric tape, with some pockets of weakness in small caps but broadly supportive conditions for risk assets.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is concentrated in large-cap US equities, especially tech and growth. The Nasdaq Composite is a clear standout on the day, up 0.54%, while SPY is also strong at +0.45%, and S&P futures add +0.44%, highlighting continued leadership from broader US large caps. On the downside, the Russell 2000 is the notable laggard with a 1-day move of -0.55%, and Russell futures are similarly weak at -0.40%, indicating underperformance in small caps relative to mega-caps. Over the week, Nasdaq benchmarks (Nasdaq Composite +1.55% 7d, Nasdaq futures +2.33% 7d) lead, while the Dow 30 is the main weekly underperformer at -0.70%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["The tape is being driven primarily by a tech-led risk-on narrative. News flow highlights that stocks are set to extend a tech-led rally, with US futures pointing higher as investors continue to chase momentum in technology and AI-linked names, consistent with the Nasdaq Composite's 0.54% 1-day and 1.55% 7-day gains and the Nasdaq futures' 2.33% weekly rise. This favors a pro-cyclical, growth-oriented risk-on bias, especially in large-cap tech, and explains why QQQ and Nasdaq-linked benchmarks are outperforming broader indices.","Macro expectations around upcoming US economic data and central bank dynamics are another key theme. Headlines note that US economic data are being awaited and that S&P futures gain on Fed rate cut hopes, aligning with a slightly lower 10Y yield over the week (-0.60%) and a weaker US Dollar over 1d, 7d, and 30d, which collectively point to easier perceived financial conditions and support for risk assets. At the same time, crypto commentary around remaining range-bound post-FOMC, alongside strong gains in Gold (+5.14% over 7d) and a bid in Bitcoin described in the news, suggests some investors are still seeking hedges and alternative assets, tempering the risk-on signal but not overwhelming the positive equity tone."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the main potential movers are scheduled US economic data releases referenced in headlines as 'U.S. economic data awaited,' which could validate or challenge current Fed rate-cut expectations and thus impact both equities and Treasury yields. In addition, any further narrative around Fed policy from follow-up commentary cited by sources like Barchart and macro-focused outlets could shift rate cut probabilities and move futures pricing. Sector-specific events such as upcoming earnings like Darden Restaurants' Q2 2026 report could affect consumer and discretionary sentiment at the margin, but the dominant trigger will likely be the macro data prints and associated rate expectations.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence – The bias for the next 24 hours is modestly up, supported by positive 1-day and 7-day gains in major indices (S&P 500 +0.42% 1d, Nasdaq Composite +0.54% 1d, ES futures +0.44% 1d, NQ futures +0.42% 1d) and a persistently low, declining VIX (-12.0% over 7d). Tech-led momentum described in the news and futures pointing to higher opens align with this constructive tone. The main risk to this view is potential disappointment from the awaited US economic data or any hawkish shift in rate expectations, but current pricing in rates and the dollar suggests the macro backdrop is benign enough to sustain a slight upward drift.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch how S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures trade around recent highs, with S&P futures near 6,961 and Nasdaq futures around 25,800 serving as reference pivots; sustained trading above these levels would confirm continuation of the tech-led advance, while failure there could signal a short-term stall. Close attention to the relative performance of QQQ versus SPY will help gauge whether leadership remains concentrated in mega-cap tech or starts to broaden, particularly given the ongoing underperformance in the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which remain negative on the day.","Macro-wise, monitoring the reaction of the 10Y Treasury yield around the 4.17% area and the VIX near the mid-teens will be crucial, as any sharp back-up in yields or spike in volatility following the upcoming US economic data could quickly challenge the current risk-on tone. Cross-asset signals from Gold, which has rallied nearly 10% over 30 days, and the weakening US Dollar index near 97.95 should also be tracked; continued dollar softness with stable yields would support the 'up' bias, while a reversal in either could pressure equities and particularly the more extended tech leadership."]

["Equities are trading with a constructive tone, with the S&P 500 up 0.42% on the day and 1.18% over the week, and the Nasdaq Composite stronger at +0.54% 1d and +1.55% 7d.
