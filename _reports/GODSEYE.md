  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities have a constructive tone with a clear tilt toward large-cap growth. The S&P 500 is up 0.46% on the day and 1.21% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite is stronger at +0.57% 1d and +1.58% 7d, indicating firm risk appetite in tech and growth. In contrast, small caps are soft, with the Russell 2000 down 0.69% on the day and 0.41% over the week, signaling some hesitation toward higher-risk domestic cyclicals even as the broader tape grinds higher.","Volatility and futures confirm an improving risk tone. The VIX is subdued at 14.0 and has fallen 0.57% on the day, 11.05% over the week, and 20.45% over 30 days, pointing to declining demand for protection. S&P and Nasdaq futures are both higher (ES +0.39% 1d, +1.85% 7d; NQ +0.46% 1d, +2.37% 7d), while rates are broadly stable with the 10Y Treasury yield flat on the day and modestly lower over the week (-0.60%), suggesting that risk appetite is improving, not surging, and is being expressed primarily via large-cap and tech exposure rather than an across-the-board beta chase.","Cross-asset signals are mixed but lean risk-on. The U.S. dollar is weaker across all windows (DXY -0.48% 1d, -1.81% 30d), which typically supports risk assets, while gold is sharply higher (+2.39% 1d, +10.68% 30d), hinting at ongoing demand for hedges or macro uncertainty even as equities rise. Taken together, the combination of rising large-cap indexes, falling volatility, stable-to-easier yields, and modest softness in small caps suggests risk appetite is improving but still selective rather than broad-based euphoria."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive with 10 assets up versus 5 down, and the average 1-day index change of about +0.24% indicates a steady, not speculative, advance. The VIX at 14 with declines of over 11% in a week and over 20% in a month shows a comfortable volatility backdrop. A 10Y Treasury yield around 4.17% that is flat on the day and slightly lower on the week suggests no acute rates stress, supporting the view of a reasonably healthy, stable risk environment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is clearly in large-cap and tech-related benchmarks, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.57% on the day and Nasdaq futures up 0.46%, while SPY mirrors the S&P 500 at +0.46%. On the downside, small caps are the notable laggards: the Russell 2000 is down 0.69% and Russell futures are off 0.71% on the day. Over the week, Nasdaq benchmarks again lead (+1.58% for the Composite, +2.37% for NQ futures), while the Dow is essentially flat (-0.03% 7d), highlighting growth and tech as relative winners versus value and small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro data and growth expectations are key drivers. News highlights note that U.S. GDP growth has unexpectedly accelerated and that surprise strength has trimmed rate-cut bets, yet major indexes have still pushed higher, which is consistent with risk-on behavior anchored in robust economic data. The characterization that S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow turned higher after the GDP surprise suggests investors are prioritizing growth momentum over the prospect of slower policy easing, a backdrop that typically favors equities, especially growth sectors.","Positioning around U.S. data releases and tech strength is also shaping the tape. Headlines point to a "tech-led rally" and futures set to "extend tech-led gains" as additional U.S. economic data are awaited, reinforcing the observed outperformance of the Nasdaq and QQQ. This combination of strong tech leadership and anticipation of more economic data leans risk-on, as investors appear comfortable adding exposure ahead of the data rather than de-risking.","Crypto and broader risk sentiment provide a secondary but supportive backdrop. Articles note that Bitcoin has "found its legs" and that crypto markets expect rebound attempts around key macro events like the FOMC meeting, while other pieces describe a global environment where investors remain broadly bullish on stocks despite select selling in overextended names. These references align with the observed decline in volatility and firm equity futures, indicating a generally constructive risk environment even as some pockets of the market recalibrate from prior extremes."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets are focused on additional U.S. economic data releases referenced in headlines as a "flurry of delayed data" that could fill in growth and inflation gaps, which may shift expectations for future rate cuts and move both equities and yields. Tech remains in the spotlight given repeated mentions of a tech-led rally, so any sector-specific news or index rebalancing updates, such as those around the Nasdaq-100 constituents, could influence leadership. Crypto-related developments around the FOMC context, mentioned in relation to Bitcoin's range-bound expectations, may also modestly affect broader risk sentiment at the margin.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both higher on the day (+0.46% and +0.57%, respectively) and over the week, while futures for these indexes are also positive (ES +0.39%, NQ +0.46%), indicating sustained upside momentum. Volatility is low and falling, with the VIX down over 11% in a week, and the 10Y Treasury yield is stable to slightly lower over 7 days, suggesting a benign rates backdrop. With news framing centered on stronger-than-expected GDP and tech-led gains, the balance of evidence supports a modest upward bias over the next 24 hours, albeit with some drag from underperforming small caps.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should monitor whether S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures can hold their recent gains around current levels near 6,957 for ES and 25,810 for NQ, as sustained strength there would validate the projected upward bias. Attention should remain on tech and growth leadership, particularly proxies like QQQ (+0.47% 1d) versus lagging small caps in the Russell 2000 (-0.69% 1d), to see if the rally continues to be narrow or begins to broaden to higher-beta domestic names.","On the macro side, focus on the incoming U.S. economic data flagged in the headlines as filling in gaps after the surprise GDP print, since any upside or downside surprises could quickly reprice rate-cut expectations and move both the 10Y yield (currently ~4.17%) and equity multiples. Cross-asset signals such as the VIX holding near 14 or drifting lower, the U.S. dollar continuing to soften (DXY -0.48% 1d), and gold's strong run (+2.39% 1d) will also be important tells for whether the current risk-on, tech-led tone persists or begins to fade."]

["Equities have a constructive tone with a clear tilt toward large-cap growth.
