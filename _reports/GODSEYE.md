  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is risk-on with a solid bounce in cash indices: the S&P 500 is up 0.64% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.69%, and the Dow 30 and Russell 2000 are stronger at +1.23% and +1.58%, respectively. However, on a 7-day basis the S&P 500 (-0.11%) and Nasdaq (-0.70%) are slightly negative, showing that the renewed risk appetite is relatively recent rather than a sustained trend over the past week.
  
  Volatility is low but edging higher, which tempers the bullish read: the VIX is at 14.90, down 37% over 30 days but up 2.69% on the day and 6.43% over the week, suggesting a mild pickup in hedging even as stocks rise. Equity futures mirror the cash market's constructive bias with S&P and Nasdaq futures up 0.15% and 0.28% on the day and roughly +6% over 30 days, while small upticks in Dow and Russell futures confirm broad participation.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals broadly support risk-taking but without aggressive easing: the 10Y Treasury yield is essentially flat over 7 days (-0.10%) and only +0.77% over 30 days, while slipping 0.53% today to 4.16, which is modestly supportive for equities. Gold futures are up 0.93% on the day and 10.39% over 30 days, and the dollar is slightly softer on the month (-1.93%), indicating some demand for both risk assets and hedges; overall, risk appetite is improving in the very near term but remains cautious compared with the weekly profile and the uptick in VIX.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks reasonably strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive, with 12 assets up versus 3 down, and the average 1-day index gain is about 0.93%, led by cyclical benchmarks like the Dow 30 (+1.23%) and Russell 2000 (+1.58%). The VIX is still low at 14.9 after a 37% drop over 30 days, even though it has risen modestly over the last week, suggesting volatility is contained. The 10Y Treasury yield is stable around 4.16 with minimal 7-day change, indicating no acute rates stress, which supports the view of a generally healthy, risk-supportive tape.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** In the last day, leadership is coming from domestically oriented and cyclical benchmarks, with the Russell 2000 up 1.58% and the Dow 30 up 1.23%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lag these but are still positive at +0.64% and +0.69%. Over the last week, the Dow 30 stands out on the upside with a 1.10% gain, contrasting with the Nasdaq Composite's 0.70% decline and QQQ's 0.66% drop, making large-cap tech a relative laggard. Small caps are modestly positive over 7 days (+0.27%), showing improving breadth beyond mega caps. On the downside, WTI crude is a notable underperformer with a 1-day move of -0.43% and a 7-day decline of -0.48%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro expectations around U.S. labor data and the Federal Reserve's next steps are a key theme, as highlighted by coverage noting that crucial jobs data on January 9th could jolt stocks and shape the Fed's rate path. With the 10Y yield essentially flat over the week and equities grinding higher, markets appear to be in a wait-and-see mode, cautiously risk-on but sensitive to any labor-market surprise that might shift rate expectations and volatility. Broader discussions of a dynamic start to 2026 and prior reports of strong U.S. growth (such as a 4.3% GDP gain referenced in recent global futures commentary) underpin the constructive backdrop for risk assets. This growth-supportive narrative aligns with the solid 30-day gains in U.S. equity futures (S&P +6.05%, Nasdaq +6.29%, Dow +7.47%, Russell +10.94%), reinforcing a medium-term risk-on tone even as near-term positioning remains measured. At the same time, macro commentary points to the Fed's communication (including upcoming FOMC minutes referenced in futures-focused news) as a potential volatility catalyst, contributing to the slight rise in VIX over the last week. This mix of strong past performance, pending jobs data, and Fed-related event risk creates a backdrop where investors are selectively adding risk but also maintaining hedges, leading to a nuanced tape that can swing risk-on or risk-off quickly around new information.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets are likely to focus on preliminary positioning ahead of the January 9th U.S. jobs report, which recent coverage flags as a key determinant of the Fed's next interest-rate move. Additionally, investors may watch for any Fed-related communication or data that could preview the tone of upcoming FOMC minutes, as referenced in commentary about S&P futures trading cautiously. These events could shift rate expectations, influence the 10Y yield around its current 4.16% level, and move equity volatility from its relatively low base.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (S&P 500 +0.64%, Dow 30 +1.23%, Russell 2000 +1.58%) and incremental strength in S&P and Nasdaq futures (+0.15% and +0.28%). Breadth is positive (12 up vs 3 down) and the 10Y yield is slightly lower on the day, which supports risk assets, while VIX remains low despite a small uptick. However, confidence is not higher than 60% because the 7-day picture is flatter to slightly negative for major indices and the news flow emphasizes upcoming jobs data and Fed-related risks that could cap near-term upside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Overnight, traders should monitor S&P futures near 6,950–7,000 and Nasdaq futures around 25,500–25,700 as key zones that validate the current risk-on bias if they hold or extend higher. Any move in the VIX away from its 14–15 area will be important: a drift lower would confirm complacent conditions favorable to an upside grind, while a push higher alongside flat futures would warn of rising hedging pressure beneath the surface. Into the next session, relative performance between cyclicals and growth will be crucial, given that the Dow 30 and Russell 2000 are leading on both the 1-day and 30-day horizons while the Nasdaq has lagged over the last week. Traders should watch small caps via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, along with rate-sensitive assets versus the 10Y yield around 4.16%, to see if lower yields continue to support equities. Price action in gold, which is up 10.39% over 30 days, and in WTI crude, which is negative over 1 and 30 days, may also signal whether the market is leaning further into risk assets or maintaining a stronger defensive and macro-hedge posture.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Across equities, the tone is risk-on with a solid bounce in cash indices: the S&P 500 is up 0.64% on the day, the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.69%, and the Dow 30 and Russell 2000 are stronger at +1.23% and +1.58%, respectively. However, on a 7-day basis the S&P 500 (-0.11%) and Nasdaq (-0.70%) are slightly negative, showing that the renewed risk appetite is relatively recent rather than a sustained trend over the past week.

Volatility is low but edging higher, which tempers the bullish read: the VIX is at 14.90, down 37% over 30 days but up 2.69% on the day and 6.43% over the week, suggesting a mild pickup in hedging even as stocks rise. Equity futures mirror the cash market's constructive bias with S&P and Nasdaq futures up 0.15% and 0.28% on the day and roughly +6% over 30 days, while small upticks in Dow and Russell futures confirm broad participation.

Rates and cross-asset signals broadly support risk-taking but without aggressive easing: the 10Y Treasury yield is essentially flat over 7 days (-0.10%) and only +0.77% over 30 days, while slipping 0.53% today to 4.16, which is modestly supportive for equities. Gold futures are up 0.93% on the day and 10.39% over 30 days, and the dollar is slightly softer on the month (-1.93%), indicating some demand for both risk assets and hedges; overall, risk appetite is improving in the very near term but remains cautious compared with the weekly profile and the uptick in VIX.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks reasonably strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive, with 12 assets up versus 3 down, and the average 1-day index gain is about 0.93%, led by cyclical benchmarks like the Dow 30 (+1.23%) and Russell 2000 (+1.58%). The VIX is still low at 14.9 after a 37% drop over 30 days, even though it has risen modestly over the last week, suggesting volatility is contained. The 10Y Treasury yield is stable around 4.16 with minimal 7-day change, indicating no acute rates stress, which supports the view of a generally healthy, risk-supportive tape.

1.2. **Leadership:** In the last day, leadership is coming from domestically oriented and cyclical benchmarks, with the Russell 2000 up 1.58% and the Dow 30 up 1.23%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lag these but are still positive at +0.64% and +0.69%. Over the last week, the Dow 30 stands out on the upside with a 1.10% gain, contrasting with the Nasdaq Composite's 0.70% decline and QQQ's 0.66% drop, making large-cap tech a relative laggard. Small caps are modestly positive over 7 days (+0.27%), showing improving breadth beyond mega caps. On the downside, WTI crude is a notable underperformer with a 1-day move of -0.43% and a 7-day decline of -0.48%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro expectations around U.S. labor data and the Federal Reserve's next steps are a key theme, as highlighted by coverage noting that crucial jobs data on January 9th could jolt stocks and shape the Fed's rate path. With the 10Y yield essentially flat over the week and equities grinding higher, markets appear to be in a wait-and-see mode, cautiously risk-on but sensitive to any labor-market surprise that might shift rate expectations and volatility. Broader discussions of a dynamic start to 2026 and prior reports of strong U.S. growth (such as a 4.3% GDP gain referenced in recent global futures commentary) underpin the constructive backdrop for risk assets. This growth-supportive narrative aligns with the solid 30-day gains in U.S. equity futures (S&P +6.05%, Nasdaq +6.29%, Dow +7.47%, Russell +10.94%), reinforcing a medium-term risk-on tone even as near-term positioning remains measured. At the same time, macro commentary points to the Fed's communication (including upcoming FOMC minutes referenced in futures-focused news) as a potential volatility catalyst, contributing to the slight rise in VIX over the last week.

Additionally, investors may watch for any Fed-related communication or data that could preview the tone of upcoming FOMC minutes, as referenced in commentary about S&P futures trading cautiously. These events could shift rate expectations, influence the 10Y yield around its current 4.16% level, and move equity volatility from its relatively low base.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's broad-based equity gains (S&P 500 +0.64%, Dow 30 +1.23%, Russell 2000 +1.58%) and incremental strength in S&P and Nasdaq futures (+0.15% and +0.28%). Breadth is positive (12 up vs 3 down) and the 10Y yield is slightly lower on the day, which supports risk assets, while VIX remains low despite a small uptick. However, confidence is not higher than 60% because the 7-day picture is flatter to slightly negative for major indices and the news flow emphasizes upcoming jobs data and Fed-related risks that could cap near-term upside.

3.2. **Watch List:** Overnight, traders should monitor S&P futures near 6,950–7,000 and Nasdaq futures around 25,500–25,700 as key zones that validate the current risk-on bias if they hold or extend higher. Any move in the VIX away from its 14–15 area will be important: a drift lower would confirm complacent conditions favorable to an upside grind, while a push higher alongside flat futures would warn of rising hedging pressure beneath the surface. Into the next session, relative performance between cyclicals and growth will be crucial, given that the Dow 30 and Russell 2000 are leading on both the 1-day and 30-day horizons while the Nasdaq has lagged over the last week. Traders should watch small caps via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, along with rate-sensitive assets versus the 10Y yield around 4.16%, to see if lower yields continue to support equities. Price action in gold, which is up 10.39% over 30 days, and in WTI crude, which is negative over 1 and 30 days, may also signal whether the market is leaning further into risk assets or maintaining a stronger defensive and macro-hedge posture.
