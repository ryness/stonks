  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities were mixed with a slight negative tilt: S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%. Breadth was nearly even (7 up, 8 down) and the average index move was -0.05%, signaling only a marginally risk-off day on balance. However, on the week risk appetite faded more decisively, with the S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, and Russell -3.11%.
  
  Volatility eased on the day but remains elevated: VIX fell 0.85% to 19.83, yet is up 10.11% over 7 days and 19.10% over 30 days. Futures echoed the mixed tone with ES -0.07%, NQ flat, YM -0.67%, and RTY +0.25%, pointing to tentative stabilization rather than a firm risk-on turn.
  
  Rates firmed with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% to 4.15, a headwind for equities at the margin. Commodities were split—gold -2.37% (less haven demand) and WTI crude +2.39% (cyclical pulse)—while the US dollar was little changed on the day (+0.09%) but lower on the week (-0.93%). Net-net, risk appetite improved modestly intraday but remains fragile given higher yields and elevated volatility versus recent weeks.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious-neutral. Breadth was nearly balanced at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners, and the average index change was a small -0.05%, suggesting no decisive trend. Volatility eased on the day but the VIX at 19.83 is still elevated versus the past week and month, and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% d/d), both tempering risk appetite. Overall, the tape looks stable but fragile after a weak week for risk benchmarks.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated with small caps and tech edging up on the day: the Russell 2000 rose +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite gained +0.13%, while the Dow lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, laggards were the Russell 2000 (-3.11%) and Nasdaq (-2.55%), while the Dow (-0.35%) comparatively outperformed.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment is still digesting a tech-led sell-off and concerns about China, as highlighted by reporting that global markets struggled after Wall Street’s worst day in a month amid an unprecedented slump in investment in China. This backdrop aligns with the weekly drawdowns in the Nasdaq (-2.55%) and Russell (-3.11%) and the 7-day rise in VIX (+10.11%), reinforcing a risk-off overhang. On the supportive side, headlines noting Australia’s welcome of the removal of US tariffs on certain food imports point to a marginally pro-trade tone. Combined with a softer US dollar over the week (-0.93%) and a daily uptick in cyclicals like WTI crude (+2.39%), this may have aided today’s tentative risk stabilization (Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%), though the effect was modest relative to broader China/tech concerns.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Given the mixed tape (S&P 500 -0.05%, Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%, Dow -0.65%), easing VIX on the day (-0.85%) but elevated on the week (+10.11%), and a 10Y yield up to 4.15 (+0.88%), the most likely near-term path is sideways. The lingering China/tech overhang noted in headlines tempers upside, while today’s stabilization across futures (ES -0.07%, NQ flat, RTY +0.25%) limits downside conviction.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether VIX holds below the 20 handle (last 19.83) and if the 10Y yield stays near 4.15; a sub-20 VIX with steady-to-softer yields would support a flat-to-firm tone, while a VIX push back above 20 or yields rising further would skew risk-off. Key reference levels: S&P 500 6,734, ES 6,755, Nasdaq Composite 22,901, and Dow 47,147. Monitor leadership between mega-cap tech and small caps via QQQ (608.86) and Russell benchmarks (RUT 2,388; RTY futures 2,396). Also track the US dollar at 99.27 (a firmer dollar could pressure risk) and WTI near 60 (sustained strength would bolster cyclicals); any fresh headlines on China’s investment backdrop or tech-sector sentiment could quickly tip the balance from flat.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-15T18:35:25.810867+00:00">2025-11-15 18:35 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 26s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities were mixed with a slight negative tilt: S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, and Russell 2000 +0.22%. Breadth was nearly even (7 up, 8 down) and the average index move was -0.05%, signaling only a marginally risk-off day on balance. However, on the week risk appetite faded more decisively, with the S&P 500 -0.91%, Nasdaq -2.55%, and Russell -3.11%.

Volatility eased on the day but remains elevated: VIX fell 0.85% to 19.83, yet is up 10.11% over 7 days and 19.10% over 30 days. Futures echoed the mixed tone with ES -0.07%, NQ flat, YM -0.67%, and RTY +0.25%, pointing to tentative stabilization rather than a firm risk-on turn.

Rates firmed with the 10Y Treasury yield up 0.88% to 4.15, a headwind for equities at the margin. Commodities were split—gold -2.37% (less haven demand) and WTI crude +2.39% (cyclical pulse)—while the US dollar was little changed on the day (+0.09%) but lower on the week (-0.93%). Net-net, risk appetite improved modestly intraday but remains fragile given higher yields and elevated volatility versus recent weeks.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious-neutral. Breadth was nearly balanced at 7 advancers vs 8 decliners, and the average index change was a small -0.05%, suggesting no decisive trend. Volatility eased on the day but the VIX at 19.83 is still elevated versus the past week and month, and the 10Y yield rose to 4.15 (+0.88% d/d), both tempering risk appetite. Overall, the tape looks stable but fragile after a weak week for risk benchmarks.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated with small caps and tech edging up on the day: the Russell 2000 rose +0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite gained +0.13%, while the Dow lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, laggards were the Russell 2000 (-3.11%) and Nasdaq (-2.55%), while the Dow (-0.35%) comparatively outperformed.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment is still digesting a tech-led sell-off and concerns about China, as highlighted by reporting that global markets struggled after Wall Street’s worst day in a month amid an unprecedented slump in investment in China. This backdrop aligns with the weekly drawdowns in the Nasdaq (-2.55%) and Russell (-3.11%) and the 7-day rise in VIX (+10.11%), reinforcing a risk-off overhang. On the supportive side, headlines noting Australia’s welcome of the removal of US tariffs on certain food imports point to a marginally pro-trade tone. Combined with a softer US dollar over the week (-0.93%) and a daily uptick in cyclicals like WTI crude (+2.39%), this may have aided today’s tentative risk stabilization (Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%), though the effect was modest relative to broader China/tech concerns.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 60% Given the mixed tape (S&P 500 -0.05%, Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%, Dow -0.65%), easing VIX on the day (-0.85%) but elevated on the week (+10.11%), and a 10Y yield up to 4.15 (+0.88%), the most likely near-term path is sideways. The lingering China/tech overhang noted in headlines tempers upside, while today’s stabilization across futures (ES -0.07%, NQ flat, RTY +0.25%) limits downside conviction.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether VIX holds below the 20 handle (last 19.83) and if the 10Y yield stays near 4.15; a sub-20 VIX with steady-to-softer yields would support a flat-to-firm tone, while a VIX push back above 20 or yields rising further would skew risk-off. Key reference levels: S&P 500 6,734, ES 6,755, Nasdaq Composite 22,901, and Dow 47,147. Monitor leadership between mega-cap tech and small caps via QQQ (608.86) and Russell benchmarks (RUT 2,388; RTY futures 2,396). Also track the US dollar at 99.27 (a firmer dollar could pressure risk) and WTI near 60 (sustained strength would bolster cyclicals); any fresh headlines on China’s investment backdrop or tech-sector sentiment could quickly tip the balance from flat.
