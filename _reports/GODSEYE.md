  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a tentative risk-on stabilization today after a rough week. The S&P 500 rose 0.26%, Dow 0.44%, and Russell 2000 0.51%, while the Nasdaq Composite was nearly flat at 0.04% and QQQ slipped 0.01%. Over the last 7 days, risk appetite clearly faded with sizable drawdowns (Nasdaq -5.63%, Russell -5.47%, S&P -4.31%, Dow -4.77%), so today’s bounce is constructive but modest relative to the recent damage.
  
  Volatility eased slightly on the day but remains elevated: VIX sits at 26.26, down 0.61% 1d but up 49.97% over the week, underscoring lingering stress. Index futures are firmer on the day (ES +0.24%, NQ +0.16%, YM +0.39%, RTY +0.97%), yet all are still down 4.40% to 5.67% over 7 days, pointing to stabilization rather than a full turn.
  
  Rates provide a mild tailwind, with the 10Y Treasury yield down 1.05% on the day to 4.06% and roughly flat over the week (-0.05%). Cross-asset signals are mixed: gold is up 0.34% 1d but down 3.19% 7d, WTI crude fell 2.71% 1d, and the US Dollar is little changed 1d (+0.04%) but firmer 7d (+0.73%). Netting it out, risk appetite is improving at the margin today but remains fragile given elevated volatility and recent drawdowns.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously stabilizing. Breadth is constructive (11 up vs 4 down) and the average index change is a moderate +0.25% on the day, indicating a mild rebound. However, VIX at 26.26 is high despite a 0.61% day-over-day dip, and the 10Y yield easing to 4.06% (-1.05% 1d) suggests some support from rates but not a full risk reset. Overall, conditions are better than earlier in the week but still tentative given the elevated volatility backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today tilted toward cyclicals and small caps: the Russell 2000 gained 0.51% and the Dow 30 rose 0.44%, while QQQ lagged at -0.01% and the Nasdaq Composite was up just 0.04%. Over the last week, tech was the clear laggard with QQQ down 5.71% and Nasdaq futures down 5.67%, while the S&P 500’s 4.31% decline was relatively less severe among the major US equity benchmarks.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Nvidia’s earnings beat rekindled confidence in the AI trade and supported a rebound in equities, as highlighted across multiple reports noting US stocks popped on the results. This has contributed to a day-over-day lift in futures (ES +0.24%, NQ +0.16%) and a stabilization in broader risk sentiment, a risk-on impulse that contrasts with the prior week’s tech-led drawdown. Headlines also point to a long-delayed US jobs report and a prior reading that “blew past expectations,” which helped drive a pop in stocks in earlier sessions. Strong labor data can be a double-edged sword for risk, but today’s backdrop shows the 10Y yield down 1.05% and VIX slightly lower, indicating markets are digesting the macro prints without adding to stress for now. Policy tone remains a counterweight, with a Fed official warning that further rate cuts carry risks, a headline consistent with the elevated VIX over the week (+49.97%) and the recent global selloff tied to concerns over lofty AI valuations. That mix has kept volatility high and capped risk appetite even as today’s session shows tactical improvement.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The key near-term catalyst is the long-delayed US jobs report flagged in coverage, which could swing rates and equity sentiment; a stronger print may pressure rate-cut hopes and volatility, while a cooler outcome could ease yields and support risk. No other concrete earnings or policy events are specified in the provided data for the next 24 hours.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Given the modest 1d rebound (average index +0.25%, ES +0.24%) and slightly lower VIX alongside a 1.05% drop in the 10Y yield, near-term tone is stabilizing, but elevated weekly losses and VIX +49.97% over 7d argue for caution. The balance of a tech lag (QQQ -0.01% 1d) and small-cap strength (RTY +0.97% futures 1d) suggests consolidation is more likely than a directional breakout ahead of jobs-related headlines.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether ES can hold the 6,573.50 area and if NQ can stabilize around 24,170.75; firmness there would reinforce a flat-to-stable bias. For leadership tells, monitor the Russell 2000 near 2,316.85 and QQQ around 585.64; continued small-cap outperformance with QQQ basing would support broader stabilization. Keep an eye on the VIX around 26; a drift lower would validate calmer conditions, while a jump would threaten the bounce. In rates, the 10Y near 4.06% is pivotal—further easing would aid equities, while a backup could pressure tech. Across commodities and FX, WTI at 57.54 is a drag on energy, and a firm US Dollar (7d +0.73%) can pressure risk assets; stabilization in oil and a softer dollar would help cyclicals. Breadth staying positive (11 up vs 4 down today) is a key check on whether the rebound broadens or fades.
