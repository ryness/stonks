  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-on but rotational rather than broad-based. The S&P 500 and SPY slipped about 0.09% while the Dow fell 0.38%, yet growth and beta pockets outperformed, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, QQQ up 0.12%, and the Russell 2000 up 0.21%. Average 1d index performance was essentially flat at -0.01%, and breadth skewed positive with 10 benchmarks up versus 5 down, indicating that risk appetite is improving beneath the surface despite headline S&P weakness.","Volatility and rates are a modest offset to this improving risk tone. The VIX rose 1.54% on the day to 17.19 and is up 4.69% over 30 days, signaling some demand for protection even as 7d VIX is slightly lower. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.34% on the day and more than 4% over both 7d and 30d to 4.19%, indicating a persistent back-up in yields that typically pressures valuations and tempers exuberance.","Futures markets suggest a cautiously constructive bias. S&P futures gained 0.05% on the day and 0.37% over the week, while Nasdaq futures are up 1.23% over 7d despite being nearly flat on the day, and Russell futures lead on a 7d basis with a 2.10% rise. This mix of higher equity futures, still-elevated but contained volatility, and rising yields points to a tentative, selective risk-on environment rather than a full-throttle chase, with risk appetite modestly improving but constrained by the rate backdrop."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks mildly constructive but not exuberant. Breadth is favorable with 10 assets up versus 5 down, and the average 1d index change is essentially flat at -0.01%, showing no sign of a broad risk-off flush. The VIX at 17.19 is slightly higher on the day but not stressed, while the 10Y yield at 4.19% has climbed more than 4% over the past week and month, which is a headwind but not yet disorderly. Overall, the tape appears reasonably healthy with selective leadership and some rate-related tension rather than systemic stress.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership has rotated toward growth and small caps over the last day and week. On the day, the Russell 2000 is a positive standout among major U.S. equity benchmarks, up 0.21%, and the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ also gained 0.13% and 0.12%, respectively, while S&P futures added 0.05%. On the downside, the Dow 30 lagged with a 0.38% decline, and Russell futures slipped 0.16% on the session despite their strong 2.10% gain over the week, making the Dow the clearest near-term underperformer compared with the tech and small-cap complex.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical narratives are focused on crash risks and liquidity conditions, but today's tape suggests markets are discounting them only partially. The American Prospect's piece on potential financial crash scenarios highlights a menu of systemic concerns, yet U.S. equities show only marginal S&P and Dow pullbacks with improving breadth and risk-on leadership in Nasdaq and Russell. This combination implies that while tail-risk discourse is elevated, current price action is more consistent with a cautious risk-on stance than with an imminent de-risking.","U.S.-China tech policy is an important driver for growth sentiment via the Nvidia H200 export compromise discussion. Reports that the White House is floating a deal to allow Nvidia H200 AI chip sales to China, with Trump signaling openness if the U.S. takes a 25% cut and indications that Xi responded positively, support the AI and semiconductor narrative. This is a clear risk-on catalyst for Nasdaq and QQQ, which both outperformed on the day and over the week, and helps explain why tech benchmarks are resilient despite higher rates.","Global equity tone is more mixed, with Asian shares mostly slipping after Wall Street pulled back from record highs, as noted by Japan Today and ABC News. However, U.S. futures edging higher in those same reports align with today's modest gains in S&P and Dow futures and stronger 7d performance in Nasdaq and Russell futures. That divergence underscores a U.S.-centric risk-on bias driven by AI and growth themes, even as global markets digest prior record levels and remain more cautious."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key near-term triggers include ongoing headlines and any concrete policy details around the U.S.-China Nvidia H200 export compromise, which could further bolster AI and semiconductor-related risk-on sentiment if terms appear favorable. Updates related to broader crash-risk debates and liquidity conditions, such as those discussed in macro commentary about potential financial crashes, could shift volatility and risk appetite if new systemic concerns emerge. Global equity follow-through, particularly from Asia after their recent pullback from record highs, will also matter over the next 24 hours as U.S. futures currently point slightly higher and any reversal abroad could dampen that tone.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — The next 24 hours lean modestly higher as leadership rests with growth and small caps (Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, QQQ +0.12%, Russell 2000 +0.21% on the day) and futures are positive over the week (Nasdaq Fut +1.23%, Russell Fut +2.10%, S&P Fut +0.37% over 7d). Breadth is supportive at 10 up vs 5 down with an average index change essentially flat, suggesting no broad de-risking, while the main headwind is a firmer rate backdrop (10Y +4.2% over 7d and +4.7% over 30d) and a slightly higher VIX (+1.54% 1d). Incremental positive catalysts from the Nvidia-China export news for AI and tech further tilt the balance toward a cautious risk-on bias rather than a pullback.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether tech and small caps can extend leadership, focusing on the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ versus the S&P 500 and Dow. Sustained outperformance in Nasdaq and Russell futures, which are up 1.23% and 2.10% on the week respectively, would validate the modest risk-on call, while any reversal with QQQ and Russell 2000 rolling over toward their recent 30d declines would challenge the upward bias. Monitoring intraday behavior around current closes near 23,576 for the Nasdaq Composite and 2,526 for the Russell 2000 will be key for gauging follow-through.","Macro-wise, the rate and volatility backdrop should remain front and center, with the 10Y Treasury stuck near 4.19% after a more than 4% rise over the past week and the VIX at 17.19, up 4.69% over 30 days. A stabilizing or slight pullback in yields and VIX would support further equity gains consistent with the "up" bias, while another push higher in yields could quickly cap upside, especially for valuation-sensitive growth names. Traders should also track any fresh detail on the Nvidia H200 export compromise with China, as more concrete or market-friendly terms could fuel additional bid in AI-linked tech and keep Nasdaq futures biased higher overnight."]

## 1. Pulse

["Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-on but rotational rather than broad-based. The S&P 500 and SPY slipped about 0.09% while the Dow fell 0.38%, yet growth and beta pockets outperformed, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, QQQ up 0.12%, and the Russell 2000 up 0.21%. Average 1d index performance was essentially flat at -0.01%, and breadth skewed positive with 10 benchmarks up versus 5 down, indicating that risk appetite is improving beneath the surface despite headline S&P weakness.","Volatility and rates are a modest offset to this improving risk tone. The VIX rose 1.54% on the day to 17.19 and is up 4.69% over 30 days, signaling some demand for protection even as 7d VIX is slightly lower. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.34% on the day and more than 4% over both 7d and 30d to 4.19%, indicating a persistent back-up in yields that typically pressures valuations and tempers exuberance.","Futures markets suggest a cautiously constructive bias. S&P futures gained 0.05% on the day and 0.37% over the week, while Nasdaq futures are up 1.23% over 7d despite being nearly flat on the day, and Russell futures lead on a 7d basis with a 2.10% rise. This mix of higher equity futures, still-elevated but contained volatility, and rising yields points to a tentative, selective risk-on environment rather than a full-throttle chase, with risk appetite modestly improving but constrained by the rate backdrop."]

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks mildly constructive but not exuberant. Breadth is favorable with 10 assets up versus 5 down, and the average 1d index change is essentially flat at -0.01%, showing no sign of a broad risk-off flush. The VIX at 17.19 is slightly higher on the day but not stressed, while the 10Y yield at 4.19% has climbed more than 4% over the past week and month, which is a headwind but not yet disorderly. Overall, the tape appears reasonably healthy with selective leadership and some rate-related tension rather than systemic stress.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership has rotated toward growth and small caps over the last day and week. On the day, the Russell 2000 is a positive standout among major U.S. equity benchmarks, up 0.21%, and the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ also gained 0.13% and 0.12%, respectively, while S&P futures added 0.05%. On the downside, the Dow 30 lagged with a 0.38% decline, and Russell futures slipped 0.16% on the session despite their strong 2.10% gain over the week, making the Dow the clearest near-term underperformer compared with the tech and small-cap complex.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical narratives are focused on crash risks and liquidity conditions, but today's tape suggests markets are discounting them only partially. The American Prospect's piece on potential financial crash scenarios highlights a menu of systemic concerns, yet U.S. equities show only marginal S&P and Dow pullbacks with improving breadth and risk-on leadership in Nasdaq and Russell. This combination implies that while tail-risk discourse is elevated, current price action is more consistent with a cautious risk-on stance than with an imminent de-risking.","U.S.-China tech policy is an important driver for growth sentiment via the Nvidia H200 export compromise discussion. Reports that the White House is floating a deal to allow Nvidia H200 AI chip sales to China, with Trump signaling openness if the U.S. takes a 25% cut and indications that Xi responded positively, support the AI and semiconductor narrative. This is a clear risk-on catalyst for Nasdaq and QQQ, which both outperformed on the day and over the week, and helps explain why tech benchmarks are resilient despite higher rates.","Global equity tone is more mixed, with Asian shares mostly slipping after Wall Street pulled back from record highs, as noted by Japan Today and ABC News. However, U.S. futures edging higher in those same reports align with today's modest gains in S&P and Dow futures and stronger 7d performance in Nasdaq and Russell futures. That divergence underscores a U.S.-centric risk-on bias driven by AI and growth themes, even as global markets digest prior record levels and remain more cautious."

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key near-term triggers include ongoing headlines and any concrete policy details around the U.S.-China Nvidia H200 export compromise, which could further bolster AI and semiconductor-related risk-on sentiment if terms appear favorable. Updates related to broader crash-risk debates and liquidity conditions, such as those discussed in macro commentary about potential financial crashes, could shift volatility and risk appetite if new systemic concerns emerge. Global equity follow-through, particularly from Asia after their recent pullback from record highs, will also matter over the next 24 hours as U.S. futures currently point slightly higher and any reversal abroad could dampen that tone.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — The next 24 hours lean modestly higher as leadership rests with growth and small caps (Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, QQQ +0.12%, Russell 2000 +0.21% on the day) and futures are positive over the week (Nasdaq Fut +1.23%, Russell Fut +2.10%, S&P Fut +0.37% over 7d). Breadth is supportive at 10 up vs 5 down with an average index change essentially flat, suggesting no broad de-risking, while the main headwind is a firmer rate backdrop (10Y +4.2% over 7d and +4.7% over 30d) and a slightly higher VIX (+1.54% 1d). Incremental positive catalysts from the Nvidia-China export news for AI and tech further tilt the balance toward a cautious risk-on bias rather than a pullback.

3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether tech and small caps can extend leadership, focusing on the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ versus the S&P 500 and Dow. Sustained outperformance in Nasdaq and Russell futures, which are up 1.23% and 2.10% on the week respectively, would validate the modest risk-on call, while any reversal with QQQ and Russell 2000 rolling over toward their recent 30d declines would challenge the upward bias. Monitoring intraday behavior around current closes near 23,576 for the Nasdaq Composite and 2,526 for the Russell 2000 will be key for gauging follow-through.","Macro-wise, the rate and volatility backdrop should remain front and center, with the 10Y Treasury stuck near 4.19% after a more than 4% rise over the past week and the VIX at 17.19, up 4.69% over 30 days. A stabilizing or slight pullback in yields and VIX would support further equity gains consistent with the "up" bias, while another push higher in yields could quickly cap upside, especially for valuation-sensitive growth names. Traders should also track any fresh detail on the Nvidia H200 export compromise with China, as more concrete or market-friendly terms could fuel additional bid in AI-linked tech and keep Nasdaq futures biased higher overnight."]
