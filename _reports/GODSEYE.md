  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite is fading as equities fell broadly: S&P 500 -0.92%, Dow -1.18%, Nasdaq -0.84%, and small caps underperformed with the Russell 2000 -1.96% on the day. Breadth was weak at 1 up vs 14 down, and the average index change was -1.11%, signaling a decisive risk-off tilt.
  
  Volatility rose sharply with the VIX up 12.86% to 22.38 on the day and up 36.71% over 30 days, indicating a higher risk premium. Futures point to continued caution into the next session with S&P -0.38%, Nasdaq -0.49%, Dow -0.26%, and Russell -0.52%.
  
  Rates offered only a small offset as the 10Y Treasury yield dipped 0.36% on the day to 4.13, though it is still up 0.98% over the week, keeping financial conditions tight. Commodities and FX were soft-to-mixed with Gold -1.44%, WTI Crude -0.68%, and the US Dollar -0.11% on the day, reinforcing a risk-off bias expressed mainly through equities and volatility.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is weak. Breadth skewed decisively negative at 1 up vs 14 down and the average index change was -1.11%, showing broad selling pressure. The VIX jumped to 22.38 (+12.86% d/d), signaling elevated stress, while the 10Y yield eased to 4.13 (-0.36% d/d) but remains higher on the week (+0.98%), implying still-tight conditions. Overall, risk tolerance is deteriorating with small caps notably heavier.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed defensive/risk-off: the VIX was the standout mover, spiking +12.86% on the day, while the Russell 2000 lagged at -1.96% and the Dow fell -1.18%. Over the week, small caps remained the weakest cohort (Russell futures -4.28% 7d) and the Nasdaq Composite also underperformed (-1.50% 7d) versus the S&P 500 (-0.71% 7d).
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Caution around upcoming Nvidia earnings and the US Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes is a key macro driver, as flagged by multiple reports noting investors’ focus on these events and the resumption of US economic data post-shutdown. This setup is consistent with a risk-off tone, reflected in the Nasdaq Composite -0.84% and Nasdaq futures -0.49% as investors trim exposure to AI and tech leadership ahead of the catalyst. Hawkish Federal Reserve commentary has dampened hopes for near-term rate cuts, pressuring risk assets and precious metals, with coverage noting lower gold prices tied to hawkish Fed signals. The risk implication is negative: equities fell (S&P 500 -0.92%) and volatility rose (VIX +12.86%), while the 10Y yield, though down 0.36% on the day to 4.13, is still up 0.98% over the week, keeping financial conditions restrictive. Globally, Asia opened cautiously with attention on a barrage of upcoming US data and Nvidia results, and regional headlines highlighted traders watching early demand signals and US trade talks. These cross-currents may temper downside abroad, but the US read remains risk-off given broad declines and elevated volatility.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key near-term catalysts include Nvidia’s earnings, which could sway tech and broader risk sentiment; the US Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes, offering clarity on the policy path and rate-cut expectations; and the resumption of US economic data releases post-shutdown, which could recalibrate growth and inflation views. Each has the potential to move index futures and volatility, with tech most sensitive to Nvidia and rates/financials most sensitive to the Fed minutes.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** down 60% Broad equity weakness (S&P 500 -0.92%, Russell 2000 -1.96%), an elevated and rising VIX (+12.86% to 22.38), and softer futures (ES -0.38%, NQ -0.49%) point to continued risk-off into the next 24 hours, with caution around Nvidia earnings and Fed minutes limiting dip buying; a small decline in the 10Y yield (-0.36% d/d) tempers but does not reverse the tone.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures levels into the open: S&P futures near 6,666, Nasdaq futures around 24,756, and Russell futures near 2,336; sustained pressure below these marks would confirm a risk-off continuation. Keep an eye on the VIX around 22; holding above 20–22 would corroborate stressed conditions and a sell-the-rally bias. Focus on tech and AI leadership ahead of and after Nvidia’s print, given Nasdaq’s -0.84% and NQ futures -0.49% moves; semiconductors will likely dictate the broader tape’s direction. Small caps remain a tell for domestic risk appetite with the Russell 2000 at 2,341 and RTY futures at 2,336; further underperformance would signal tightening financial conditions are still biting. Monitor rates and commodities for confirmation: the 10Y yield near 4.13 is pivotal for equity multiples and financials, while WTI around 59.51 and Gold near 4,009 can signal growth and haven dynamics. If Fed minutes lean hawkish and the 10Y backs up on the week’s trend (+0.98% 7d), expect defensives and volatility to stay bid.
