  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities finished mixed but stabilizing: S&P 500 up 0.13% and Dow up 0.16% while the Nasdaq slipped 0.21%, with small caps leading at +0.58%. Breadth tilts constructive (9 up, 5 down, 1 flat) and the average index change is a modest +0.07%, signaling tentative risk appetite after a tough week where the S&P 500 fell 2.35% and the Nasdaq 3.98%.
  
  Volatility eased on the day with VIX down 2.15% to 19.08, yet remains elevated on a 7-day basis (+12.77%) and over 30 days (+24.79%), underscoring lingering caution. Futures echo a rotation tone: S&P +0.09%, Dow +0.12%, Russell +0.54% versus Nasdaq -0.31%, indicating risk appetite is improving at the margin today but still fragile, particularly for growth/tech.
  
  Rates were steady with the 10Y Treasury at 4.09% (0.00% on the day), up 0.86% over the week but down 2.25% over 30 days, a neutral-to-slightly supportive backdrop near term. Cross-asset signals are mixed: gold firmed (+0.75% 1d; +6.21% 30d) and oil remains weak on a 30-day basis (-9.08%), while the dollar dipped 0.17% on the day; net-net, risk appetite is modestly improving today but has faded on the week.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously constructive on the day but soft on the week. Breadth shows 9 up, 5 down, and 1 flat with an average index gain of 0.07%, indicating stabilization after recent declines. Volatility eased intraday (VIX -2.15% to 19.08) though its 7-day jump (+12.77%) signals lingering risk aversion. The 10Y Treasury yield was flat at 4.09% today, a neutral rates backdrop that modestly supports a pause in the selloff.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 0.58% as a positive standout, while growth lagged as the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.21% and QQQ declined 0.32%. Over the last week, tech has led the downside (Nasdaq futures -4.17% and QQQ -4.09%), whereas the Dow 30 has comparatively outperformed at -1.35%, highlighting a defensive, value-tilted bias.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A tech-led pullback tied to valuation concerns remains the dominant macro theme, with multiple reports flagging stretched levels and high-profile warnings about potential corrections as well as notable short positioning against AI beneficiaries. This has pressured semiconductors and megacap growth, translating into a risk-off skew for the Nasdaq over the week (Nasdaq Composite -3.98%, Nasdaq futures -4.17%). Softening U.S. labor signals and cautious tone in headlines have kept risk appetite in check, with markets reacting to deteriorating jobs data and tepid dip-buying in Big Tech. The weekly rise in VIX (+12.77%) alongside a modest uptick in the 10Y yield over the week (+0.86%) reinforces a defensive posture, while gold’s strength (+6.21% over 30 days) reflects continued demand for havens.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** U.S. consumer sentiment/confidence data and scheduled Federal Reserve commentary are on tap within 24 hours; stronger sentiment could buoy cyclicals and keep VIX contained, while a weak print or hawkish Fed tone could extend tech weakness and support a risk-off tilt.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% - Mixed signals dominate: modest positive breadth (9 up vs 5 down), small gains in S&P/Dow, and VIX easing today (-2.15%) argue for stabilization, but elevated weekly volatility (+12.77%), continued Nasdaq underperformance (-0.21% 1d; -4.17% 7d futures), and a neutral-to-slightly higher weekly 10Y yield (+0.86%) cap upside ahead of sentiment data and Fed speak.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether VIX holds below 20 and if Nasdaq futures (-0.31% 1d) stabilize relative to S&P futures (+0.09%); a narrowing gap would support a flat-to-firmer tape. In rates, the 10Y at 4.09% is the pivot: stability there favors consolidation, while a push higher could re-pressure duration‑sensitive tech. Sector-wise, monitor semiconductors and megacap tech for signs of exhaustion in the selloff versus continued rotation into small caps (Russell futures +0.54% 1d). On cross-asset risk gauges, gold staying firm near 4,009.8 and WTI near $60 with the dollar at 99.56 will inform whether defense remains in favor or risk can broaden into the close.
