  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities are showing a constructive, risk-on tone today, with all four major US indexes higher: S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, Dow 30 +0.38%, and Russell 2000 +0.86%. ETFs echo this, with SPY up 0.91% and QQQ up 1.30%, pointing to renewed appetite for large-cap growth and tech after a weak prior week (e.g., Nasdaq -1.46% and QQQ -1.68% over 7d). Breadth across tracked assets is strong at 13 up vs 2 down, and the average 1-day index move is about +0.94%, quantifying a broad-based improvement in risk appetite on the day despite mixed 7-day performance.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm the risk-on skew but with more moderate conviction. The VIX is down sharply, -11.62% on the day and almost -17.21% over 30 days to 14.91, indicating investors are willing to pay less for downside protection as spot indices grind higher. Equity futures are positive but less exuberant than cash: S&P futures +0.27%, Nasdaq futures +0.42%, and Dow futures +0.21% on 1d, while Russell futures are marginally negative at -0.02%, suggesting small-cap participation is stronger in cash than in forward pricing and that some caution remains about extending the move.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are moderately mixed but not yet derailing risk appetite. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15%, yet essentially flat over 7 days (-0.31%) and only modestly higher over 30 days (+1.42%), implying a slight backup in yields that so far coexists with equity strength. Gold is also firm (1d +0.50%, 30d +9.59%), and the US Dollar is little changed on the day (+0.17%) but softer over 30 days (-1.13%), a combination that points to some ongoing demand for safety and inflation hedges even as near-term risk appetite improves.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the near term. Breadth is strong, with 13 of 15 tracked assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1-day move across the main equity benchmarks is close to +0.94%, indicating broad participation rather than a narrow rally. The VIX's steep drop to 14.91 (1d -11.62%, 30d -17.21%) signals easing stress and healthier risk sentiment. While the 10Y Treasury yield has ticked up to 4.15% today, its flat-to-slightly higher profile over 7–30 days suggests rates are not tightening enough to seriously undermine the current equity advance.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is clearly in growth and tech: the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.31% and QQQ is up 1.30%, outpacing the S&P 500 (+0.88%) and Dow 30 (+0.38%). On a weekly view, however, the Nasdaq benchmarks lag, with the Nasdaq Composite down 1.46% and QQQ down 1.68% over 7 days, versus a modest Dow gain of 0.16% and Russell 2000 up 0.13%. A notable positive standout today is the Nasdaq Composite at +1.31%, while the weakest on the day among major futures is the Russell futures contract at -0.02%, reflecting relative small-cap softness in forward pricing.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A rebound in AI and large-cap tech is a primary macro narrative driving today's tape. News highlights that the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are rising as AI-related names like Oracle, Nvidia, and Micron lead gains, with Oracle's move tied to a major TikTok deal and renewed AI confidence. This concentrated tech strength is directly supportive of risk-on behavior, aligning with the Nasdaq Composite's +1.31% and QQQ's +1.30% 1-day gains, and helps explain why growth benchmarks are outperforming despite recent concerns about an AI-related bubble. Global monetary policy, particularly the Bank of Japan's rate hike, is another key macro theme. Headlines note that US and Asian stocks are ticking higher even as bond yields advance following the BOJ move, and that Japan's 10-year yield briefly touched 2% while Asian risk assets, including bitcoin and ether, popped higher. This backdrop of rising global yields but resilient risk assets fits with the 10Y US Treasury's modest 0.85% rise today to 4.15% and supports a cautiously risk-on stance, as investors appear to be digesting tighter policy without broad de-risking. More broadly, narratives around AI valuation and global equity positioning are present but not dominating the day's direction. Articles discuss a prior global selloff in AI names and commentary from investors like Michael Burry about an AI bubble, alongside analysis suggesting investors are selectively rotating out of overextended tech while remaining broadly bullish on stocks. Given today's strong equity breadth (13 up vs 2 down) and low VIX, these themes currently translate into risk-on with selective caution rather than an outright risk-off regime.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key potential movers over the next 24 hours are a cluster of company earnings and scheduled political communication that could influence sentiment. Darden Restaurants and FedEx are both slated to report earnings, and as consumer and logistics bellwethers, their outlooks may affect views on US demand and margins, with stronger reports likely supporting cyclicals and weaker ones weighing on indices. A primetime speech from President Trump, flagged in the news as potentially outlining new policy initiatives amid reports of economic pressure, could shift expectations around fiscal or trade policy and thus impact risk sentiment. Additionally, markets remain attuned to central bank communication and global bond yields following the Bank of Japan's recent rate hike, so any follow-on commentary that alters rate expectations could move futures and rates-sensitive sectors.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence – The major US equity benchmarks are all higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%, Dow 30 +0.38%), breadth is strong (13 up vs 2 down), and the VIX is down sharply (-11.62% to 14.91), collectively indicating a risk-on tone. Futures are also modestly positive across S&P (+0.27%), Nasdaq (+0.42%), and Dow (+0.21%), suggesting some follow-through interest. Macro news shows that markets are absorbing the BOJ rate hike and higher global yields without de-risking, while AI-led tech strength is supporting growth benchmarks. Upcoming earnings and political events could inject volatility, but given the current pattern of broad gains and suppressed volatility, a modest upward bias into the next session is more likely than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Overnight and into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P futures can hold and extend above the recent 6,796.54 level and whether the cash S&P 500 can build on today's 0.88% gain without a pickup in volatility from the VIX's low 14.91 print. The tech complex is central to the up-bias call, so monitoring Nasdaq futures around 25,132.79 and QQQ near 617.05 will be important to confirm that AI and large-cap growth leadership persists rather than stalling after a single strong day. Sector-wise, focus on tech, communication services, and semiconductors, given news-driven strength in Oracle, Nvidia, and Micron, to see if leadership broadens or narrows within growth. At the same time, keep an eye on small caps via the Russell 2000 cash index at 2,529.43 versus Russell futures at 2,509.56, since the tiny futures dip (-0.02% 1d) contrasts with stronger spot performance and could signal whether risk-on extends to higher-beta domestics. On the macro side, track the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.15%: a contained move in yields would be consistent with an orderly, risk-on grind higher, while a sharper backup could pressure growth multiples. Upcoming earnings from FedEx and Darden will be important for gauging demand and cost pressures; positive commentary there would support the current up-bias, while disappointments or unexpectedly market-moving remarks from President Trump's primetime speech could challenge the low-volatility, risk-on setup.

## 1. Pulse

Equities are showing a constructive, risk-on tone today, with all four major US indexes higher: S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, Dow 30 +0.38%, and Russell 2000 +0.86%. ETFs echo this, with SPY up 0.91% and QQQ up 1.30%, pointing to renewed appetite for large-cap growth and tech after a weak prior week (e.g., Nasdaq -1.46% and QQQ -1.68% over 7d). Breadth across tracked assets is strong at 13 up vs 2 down, and the average 1-day index move is about +0.94%, quantifying a broad-based improvement in risk appetite on the day despite mixed 7-day performance.

Volatility and futures confirm the risk-on skew but with more moderate conviction. The VIX is down sharply, -11.62% on the day and almost -17.21% over 30 days to 14.91, indicating investors are willing to pay less for downside protection as spot indices grind higher. Equity futures are positive but less exuberant than cash: S&P futures +0.27%, Nasdaq futures +0.42%, and Dow futures +0.21% on 1d, while Russell futures are marginally negative at -0.02%, suggesting small-cap participation is stronger in cash than in forward pricing and that some caution remains about extending the move.

Rates and cross-asset signals are moderately mixed but not yet derailing risk appetite. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15%, yet essentially flat over 7 days (-0.31%) and only modestly higher over 30 days (+1.42%), implying a slight backup in yields that so far coexists with equity strength. Gold is also firm (1d +0.50%, 30d +9.59%), and the US Dollar is little changed on the day (+0.17%) but softer over 30 days (-1.13%), a combination that points to some ongoing demand for safety and inflation hedges even as near-term risk appetite improves.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive in the near term. Breadth is strong, with 13 of 15 tracked assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1-day move across the main equity benchmarks is close to +0.94%, indicating broad participation rather than a narrow rally. The VIX's steep drop to 14.91 (1d -11.62%, 30d -17.21%) signals easing stress and healthier risk sentiment. While the 10Y Treasury yield has ticked up to 4.15% today, its flat-to-slightly higher profile over 7–30 days suggests rates are not tightening enough to seriously undermine the current equity advance.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is clearly in growth and tech: the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.31% and QQQ is up 1.30%, outpacing the S&P 500 (+0.88%) and Dow 30 (+0.38%). On a weekly view, however, the Nasdaq benchmarks lag, with the Nasdaq Composite down 1.46% and QQQ down 1.68% over 7 days, versus a modest Dow gain of 0.16% and Russell 2000 up 0.13%.

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence – The major US equity benchmarks are all higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, Russell 2000 +0.86%, Dow 30 +0.38%), breadth is strong (13 up vs 2 down), and the VIX is down sharply (-11.62% to 14.91), collectively indicating a risk-on tone.

LLM raw output (truncated): {\n  &quot;1.0&quot;: [\n    &quot;Equities are showing a constructive, risk-on tone today, with all four major US indexes higher: S&amp;P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, Dow 30 +0.38%, and Russell 2000 +0.86%. ETFs echo this, with SPY up 0.91% and QQQ up 1.30%, pointing to renewed appetite for large-cap growth and tech after a weak prior week (e.g., Nasdaq -1.46% and QQQ -1.68% over 7d). Breadth across tracked assets is strong at 13 up vs 2 down, and the average 1-day index move is about +0.94%, quantifying a broad-based improvement in risk appetite on the day despite mixed 7-day performance.&quot;,\n    &quot;Volat
