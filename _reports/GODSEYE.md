  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are trading with a constructive, risk-on tone, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day: S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.81%, Dow +0.48%, and Russell 2000 +0.78%. Over the past week and month, returns are modestly to strongly positive across the board, led by small caps (Russell 2000 +4.94% 7d, +6.42% 30d) and the Dow (+2.35% 7d, +5.08% 30d), indicating an improving and broadening risk appetite rather than a narrow mega-cap rally. ETFs reinforce this tone, with QQQ up 1.00% on the day and over 3% on the month, and SPY up 0.66% 1d and 3.13% 30d.","Volatility and futures also point to firm risk appetite. The VIX is down 6.21% on the day to 14.49 and nearly 22% lower over 30 days, signaling investors are paying less for downside protection even as equity indices advance. Equity futures mirror spot strength with S&P futures +0.62%, Nasdaq futures +0.98%, Dow futures +0.47%, and Russell futures +0.71% on the day, and all up between roughly 0.9% and 4.7% over the week, suggesting follow-through buying rather than a one-off squeeze.","Rates and cross-asset signals are broadly supportive, if not outright dovish. The 10Y Treasury yield is slightly lower on the day (-0.29% to 4.17%) but remains up about 1.0% over 7 days and 4.2% over 30 days, indicating that the recent equity advance is occurring alongside somewhat higher yields rather than a pure "rates down, stocks up" trade. Meanwhile, traditional hedges and cyclicals like gold (+0.91% 1d, +8.48% 30d) and WTI crude (+2.35% 1d, +2.02% 7d) are also bid, alongside a mildly stronger dollar (+0.20% 1d, +0.91% 7d), pointing to robust macro risk-taking rather than a defensive rotation."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up versus only 2 down and an average 1-day index move of about +0.73%, indicating gains are broadly shared across the complex. The VIX near 14.5 and down more than 6% on the day, alongside a flat-to-slightly lower 10Y yield at 4.17%, suggests the equity rally is not being driven by panic in rates or volatility markets. Overall, the combination of broad participation, moderate index gains, and contained volatility implies a healthy, risk-on environment rather than a fragile melt-up.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from growth and small caps, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.81% and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%, while QQQ is a standout ETF with a 1.00% 1-day gain. On the week, small caps clearly lead, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.73%, and the Dow also outperforming with a 2.35% weekly gain. On a relative basis, the Dow is a mild laggard on the day at +0.48% versus the Nasdaq and Russell near +0.8–1.0%, and the US Dollar is a modest underperformer over 30 days (-0.53%) despite a positive 1-day move of +0.20%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical themes are centered on mixed US economic data, resilient growth, and shifting expectations around Federal Reserve policy. Newsflow notes that US economic data have been mixed and are influencing Fed rate-cut expectations, while a prior report cited a 4.3% GDP gain and resilient spending, a backdrop that tends to support risk-on appetite in equities. At the same time, another headline highlights that a recent payrolls report has "sealed" rate bets that the Fed will not cut imminently, yet US indices are still higher, suggesting investors are currently interpreting resilient growth and a steady Fed stance as supportive rather than threatening.","Geopolitical risks and trade policy are also in focus, particularly around Venezuela and a key US Supreme Court case on Trump-era tariffs. Coverage points out that markets have been reacting to conflict and political developments in Venezuela, with prior sessions seeing a rally tied to strength in energy, AI, and defense stocks, indicating a selective risk-on response to geopolitical tension. Simultaneously, articles flag that the upcoming Supreme Court ruling on emergency tariff powers could materially affect tariffs and even a portion of the proposed US military budget, creating event risk that could swing sentiment risk-on if tariffs are curtailed or risk-off if expansive tariff powers are upheld and trade frictions remain elevated.","Regional dynamics in Asia and emerging markets add nuance to the global tone. Recent stories describe Asian stocks falling as optimism fades after a strong rally, even as US Treasuries hold gains, implying some regional risk fatigue despite solid US performance. Indian markets have shown caution tied to geopolitical tensions and tariff worries, and India's bond market is described as flat in the absence of new catalysts while traders brace for supply, pointing to a more neutral or slightly risk-off posture outside the US. Overall, however, these cross-currents have not derailed US risk assets, which remain bid across indices and futures."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the primary potential market mover is the US Supreme Court hearing and anticipated ruling on Trump's emergency tariff powers, which news reports highlight as a key risk event for stocks and bonds; a decision that rolls back tariff authority could be received as risk-on for global trade-sensitive equities, while an affirmation of broad tariff powers could be risk-off via renewed trade uncertainty. Additionally, global investors will be watching China's upcoming inflation (CPI) data, as flagged in Asia-Pacific previews, with a stronger-than-expected print potentially supporting cyclical and commodity demand and a weaker print reinforcing concerns about deflation and growth in Asia. There are no specific major US earnings or central bank events highlighted in the provided data for the next 24 hours, so positioning into these macro and policy headlines is likely to dominate near-term tape action.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up, 60% confidence. The most likely market direction in the next 24 hours is modestly up, given that all major US equity indices and corresponding futures are already higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78%; S&P futures +0.62%, Nasdaq futures +0.98%) and breadth is strongly positive with 13 assets up versus 2 down. The VIX is lower by 6.21% to 14.49 and the 10Y yield is slightly softer on the day, a combination that typically supports incremental follow-through buying rather than an abrupt reversal. That said, confidence is capped at 60% because the upcoming Supreme Court tariff decision and global data such as China CPI represent binary catalysts that could flip sentiment quickly in either direction depending on the headlines.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should monitor whether the S&P 500 can consolidate above its recent close near 6,966 and whether futures hold gains above roughly 7,000 on ES, as sustained trade above these areas would confirm the current risk-on bias. The Nasdaq complex is a key barometer, with the Nasdaq Composite at 23,671 and Nasdaq futures at 25,938; continued leadership from QQQ (+1.00% today) would signal that growth and AI-linked names are still attracting capital even in the face of firmer yields, while any sharp underperformance versus the Russell 2000 would hint at a rotation toward cyclicals and small caps.","Traders should also watch the reaction of rate-sensitive assets and cyclicals to the Supreme Court tariff proceedings and China CPI release. The 10Y yield around 4.17% and the VIX near 14.5 are important gauges: a spike in yields or vol on the tariff ruling would likely pressure high-duration growth names, while a benign outcome that leaves yields contained and vol subdued would underpin the current grind higher. In sectors, energy and materials bear watching given the recent strength in WTI crude (+2.35% 1d) and gold (+0.91% 1d, +8.48% 30d); continued gains there, alongside strong small-cap performance (Russell 2000 +4.94% 7d), would be consistent with the expected modestly higher tape, whereas abrupt reversals in commodities could flag a broader de-risking move."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equities are trading with a constructive, risk-on tone, with all major US benchmarks higher on the day: S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq Composite +0.81%, Dow +0.48%, and Russell 2000 +0.78%.
