  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Cross-asset tone is modestly risk-on but with signs of fatigue. US large-cap equities are up on the day, with the S&P 500 +0.41% and Dow +0.30%, while small caps edge higher (Russell 2000 +0.16%). Futures echo this constructive bias (ES +0.17%, NQ +0.15%, RTY +0.16%), and the 10Y yield is slightly lower on the day (-0.29%), providing a marginally supportive rates backdrop for risk assets.","Risk appetite is uneven across styles and sectors, with the Nasdaq Composite down on the latest close (-0.44%) even as QQQ is higher (+0.51%), pointing to rotation within growth and tech rather than broad de-risking. The VIX is low but ticking up (15.62, +1.1% on the day and +9% over 7d, though -15.8% over 30d), suggesting hedging demand has risen from very complacent levels while overall volatility remains contained, consistent with a selective rather than wholesale risk-off move.","On a multi-week horizon, risk appetite is clearly improved: all major US indices are higher over 7d and 30d, led by the Dow (+2.16% 7d, +4.88% 30d) and Russell 2000 (+4.30% 7d, +5.76% 30d), while futures show similar gains. Concurrently, gold (+8.90% over 30d) and crude (+1.97% over 30d) are firm and the dollar is slightly softer over 30d (-0.44%), painting a picture of risk-on equities coexisting with strong demand for hedges and real assets rather than a pure growth euphoria."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health screens moderately positive. Breadth is strong with 12 instruments up versus 3 down and an average 1d index change of about +0.15%, indicating gains are broad-based rather than narrowly driven. Volatility remains subdued with the VIX at 15.62 despite a 9% rise over the past week, which suggests a slight uptick in caution but still a benign volatility regime. The 10Y Treasury yield near 4.17%, down on the day but higher over 7 and 30 days, signals a market that is digesting higher-rate expectations without evident stress in risk assets.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day tilts toward mega-cap growth and cyclicals, with QQQ up +0.51% and the S&P 500 up +0.41%, while the Dow also participates at +0.30%. On the downside, the Nasdaq Composite is the clear laggard at -0.44% on the day, and SPY is essentially flat to slightly negative at -0.01%, indicating that weakness is more index-composition and timing-related than systemic. Over the last week, small caps and value/cyclical proxies are leading, with the Russell 2000 up +4.30% and Russell futures up +4.17%, while the Nasdaq Composite barely advances at +0.02%, underscoring a rotation away from the prior high-growth leaders.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical narratives are contributing to an underlying risk-on but choppy tape. A massive proposed $1.5 trillion US defense budget is boosting defense stocks and helped the Dow outperform on a recent session even as the S&P 500 (-0.25%) and Nasdaq (-0.93%) slipped, illustrating how sector-specific geopolitical spending can support headline indices despite broader growth/tech softness. This aligns with the current pattern of Dow and Russell leadership and implies a tilt toward defense, energy, and cyclicals as beneficiaries of policy-driven spending, a partial risk-on dynamic concentrated in select themes.","At the same time, global risk sentiment has cooled from earlier exuberance as Asian stocks have fallen for two days with optimism fading while US Treasuries hold prior gains. Mixed US economic data are influencing Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations, and articles highlight that fewer US jobs than forecast are unlikely to prompt an immediate rate cut, keeping policy in a tighter-for-longer posture. This backdrop helps explain the modest recent rise in the 10Y yield over 7 and 30 days alongside a slightly higher VIX, tempering risk appetite and contributing to rotations rather than a broad advance.","Another important theme is the reassessment of AI and tech profitability, with commentary warning that current AI leaders may not earn enough profits to justify their heavy capex, and Asian tech (e.g., Samsung) seeing stock declines despite strong profits. This feeds into the recent underperformance of the Nasdaq Composite on the day (-0.44%) relative to value/cyclical benchmarks and supports a more cautious stance toward high-multiple growth, even as broader indices grind higher. Together with firm gold (+1.30% 1d, +8.90% 30d) and a stronger dollar over 7 days (+1.00%), this mix points to a risk-on equity bias coexisting with hedging via commodities and FX amid macro uncertainty."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the key potential market movers are follow-through interpretations of the latest US labor market data and any additional commentary on Federal Reserve policy expectations, as coverage notes that weaker-than-forecast job gains still leave a near-term rate cut unlikely. Ongoing geopolitical developments around US defense spending plans and associated budget debates could further influence sector rotation, particularly in defense and energy, in line with prior sessions where a $1.5 trillion defense proposal moved the Dow. Additionally, traders will watch how Asian and European markets respond to fading momentum and mixed US data overnight, as recent declines in Asian equities and stable US bond gains have set the tone for global risk appetite.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given that major US indices like the S&P 500 (+0.41%) and Dow (+0.30%) are trending higher with strong breadth (12 up vs 3 down) and supportive futures (ES +0.17%, NQ +0.15%, RTY +0.16%). The 10Y yield is down slightly on the day, easing immediate rate pressure, while volatility remains low despite a mild VIX uptick, suggesting no acute stress. Macro news points to steady but not deteriorating conditions—mixed data and delayed rate cuts are tempering enthusiasm but not derailing the existing uptrend—so incremental gains with continued rotation away from the most rate-sensitive growth/tech look more probable than a broad reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should focus on whether the S&P 500 can build on its latest advance from 6,921 to 6,950 and whether futures (ES last 6,973.5, +0.17% 1d) sustain their positive bias into the open, as follow-through would confirm the short-term uptrend. Monitoring the Russell 2000 and its futures (RTY +4.17% 7d, +6.12% 30d) is key, since small caps have been notable leaders; continued outperformance here would reinforce a pro-cyclical, risk-on rotation, while a sharp fade could signal near-term exhaustion.","Sector-wise, watch Dow-linked cyclicals and defense names given the recent outperformance of the Dow (+2.16% 7d, +4.88% 30d) on budget headlines, and compare that to tech and AI proxies via the Nasdaq Composite (-0.44% 1d) and QQQ (+0.51% 1d) to see if the rotation out of crowded growth persists. On the macro side, track the 10Y yield around the 4.17% area and the VIX near 15–16; a further drift lower in yields or stabilization in the VIX would support the upward bias, while renewed spikes—especially alongside continued strength in gold (+1.30% 1d) and the dollar (+1.00% 7d)—would warn that the balance is shifting back toward defense despite the current constructive tape."]
