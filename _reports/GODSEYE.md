  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is decisively risk-on. Major US indices are all higher on the day, with the S&P 500 up 0.30%, Dow 0.86%, Nasdaq 0.17%, and small-cap Russell 2000 outperforming at 1.91%; over the past week, gains range from 3.5% to 6.0%, and the average 1-day index move is +0.64%. This is reinforced by futures, where S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts are up 2.11%, 2.77%, 3.22%, and 3.99% respectively, signaling an acceleration in risk appetite into the next session.","Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of this constructive tone. The VIX is down 3.1% on the day and more than 31% over the week to 16.08, indicating fading demand for downside protection as equities grind higher. The 10-year Treasury yield is modestly lower on the day (-0.71%) and flat over the week, suggesting that rates are not currently pressuring valuations even though they remain about 2.4% higher over 30 days, allowing equities and higher-beta assets to lead while gold's 3.27% daily jump and firm dollar hint at some residual hedging under the surface.","Overall risk appetite is improving, with strong breadth (13 assets up vs. 2 down) and synchronized gains across cyclicals, growth proxies, and small caps. The combination of rising equities, sharply higher equity futures, a 31% weekly collapse in the VIX, and only slight day-on-day softening in the 10-year yield points to investors rotating more aggressively into risk, even as commodities like gold (+3.38% over 7 days) and crude's small 1-day gain show that some diversification and defensiveness remain in place."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive with 13 instruments up and only 2 down, and the average 1-day index gain of about 0.64% shows broad participation rather than a narrow leadership spike. The VIX dropping 3.1% on the day and over 31% on the week to 16.08 reflects easing stress and a more complacent volatility regime. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield is slightly lower on the day and flat on the week around 4.06%, indicating that rates are not tightening financial conditions further in the very near term, which supports the current equity advance.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day and week is coming from small caps and Dow-linked exposures. The Russell 2000 is the standout index on the day at +1.91% (and +6.02% over the week), while Russell futures are up an even stronger 3.99% on the day, signaling aggressive risk-on in smaller, more cyclical names; Dow futures are also notably strong at +3.22% on the day. On the downside, WTI crude is a relative laggard on a weekly basis at -1.35%, and the US Dollar Index is slightly soft over the week (-1.15%), though both are modestly positive on the day (+0.75% and +0.14% respectively), making them mild underperformers versus the equity complex rather than outright drags.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical focus is centered on upcoming US economic data, particularly labor market prints like the ADP jobs report, which multiple headlines flag as a key catalyst ahead of the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. News summaries note that stocks have been treading cautiously in Asia and globally "ahead of US eco data," but also that US futures have been climbing as the data looms, suggesting that investors are leaning toward a benign or even supportive outcome that could reinforce expectations for easier Fed policy and underpin a risk-on bias.","Recent coverage emphasizes how softer or weakening US labor market data are reshaping risk appetite, Fed expectations, and liquidity, especially through channels like crypto and high-beta assets. Articles highlight that surprise declines in private-sector employment have already reinforced rate-cut bets in prior sessions, which helped lift the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq; this dynamic makes weak-but-not-disastrous data a risk-on catalyst for equities while remaining a risk-off driver for more speculative segments like Bitcoin, which has seen sharp downside amid broader concerns including quantum-computing risks.","Outside of macro, sector-specific stories around AI, LLM experimentation, and agentic commerce, as well as debates over valuations like Tesla being called "ridiculously overvalued," contribute to stock-level dispersion but are not clearly moving broad benchmarks in the provided data. The dominant tape drivers are instead the interplay between labor data, Fed-rate expectations, and the consequent risk-on tone, as seen in rising equity indices, rallying futures, and a sharply lower VIX despite some crosscurrents in crypto and select international markets such as India, where indices have turned more cautious on trade and currency concerns."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key potential market movers over the next 24 hours are US economic data releases, especially labor indicators like the ADP private payrolls report, which several headlines identify as one of the final major catalysts before the Federal Reserve's next rate decision. These prints will directly inform Fed rate-cut expectations, with weaker-than-expected jobs data likely reinforcing the recent risk-on move in equities by boosting hopes for easier policy, while stronger data could reintroduce rate-hike or "higher-for-longer" worries and pressure high-valuation and rate-sensitive segments. Additionally, any fresh commentary or updates related to the upcoming Fed meeting, even if not explicitly detailed here, will be interpreted through the same lens of how quickly policy might shift, making the macro calendar and related headlines the primary short-term triggers.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is higher, given the strong risk-on setup in the data. Cash indices are already positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.30%, Dow +0.86%, Nasdaq +0.17%, Russell 2000 +1.91%), front-month equity futures are substantially higher (S&P +2.11%, Nasdaq +2.77%, Dow +3.22%, Russell +3.99%), and the VIX is down over 3% on the day and 31% on the week, all pointing to building upside momentum. With key US labor data positioned as a major catalyst ahead of the Fed decision and recent market behavior showing that weaker jobs numbers have supported equities by reinforcing rate-cut hopes, the balance of evidence favors a continued grind higher, albeit with event-driven volatility risk if the data significantly surprise to the upside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should monitor how equity futures trade around current strong levels – S&P at 6,863, Nasdaq at 25,639.5, Dow at 48,014, and Russell at 2,515.2 – as holds or breaks around these marks will confirm or challenge the current bullish bias. Particular attention should be paid to small caps and cyclicals given the Russell 2000's leadership (cash +1.91% on the day, futures +3.99%), as sustained outperformance there would signal that the risk-on rotation is broadening beyond mega-cap tech; conversely, any sharp reversal in Russell futures would be an early warning of risk appetite cooling.","On the macro side, the key labor data over the next 24 hours should be watched closely for its impact on the 10-year Treasury yield, currently around 4.06 after a 0.71% daily decline, and on the VIX at 16.08 following a 31% weekly drop. A move in yields meaningfully above recent levels or a sharp VIX spike would challenge the current constructive setup and could cap further equity upside, while stable or lower yields and a subdued VIX would likely support the up-bias in indices; traders should therefore track the immediate post-release reaction in rates, the dollar (now just below 99), and high-beta proxies like Nasdaq futures to gauge whether the risk-on trend is being confirmed or questioned."]

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is higher, given the strong risk-on setup in the data. Cash indices are already positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.30%, Dow +0.86%, Nasdaq +0.17%, Russell 2000 +1.91%), front-month equity futures are substantially higher (S&P +2.11%, Nasdaq +2.77%, Dow +3.22%, Russell +3.99%), and the VIX is down over 3% on the day and 31% on the week, all pointing to building upside momentum.

LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Across equities, the tone is decisively risk-on. Major US indices are all higher on the day, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.30%, Dow 0.86%, Nasdaq 0.17%, and small-cap Russell 2000 outperforming at 1.91%; over the past week, gains range from 3.5% to 6.0%, and the average 1-day index move is +0.64%. This is reinforced by futures, where S&amp;P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell contracts are up 2.11%, 2.77%, 3.22%, and 3.99% respectively, signaling an acceleration in risk appetite into the next session.&quot;,&quot;Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of this constructive tone. The VIX is down 3.1% on the day
