  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across equities, the tone is clearly risk-on with broad gains and constructive momentum. The S&P 500 rose 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a 0.81% 1d gain and 1.08% over 7d. Small caps are notably strong, with the Russell 2000 up 0.78% on the day, 4.94% over the week, and 6.42% over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite further out the cap spectrum.
  
  Volatility and futures confirm this constructive backdrop. The VIX fell 6.21% on the day to 14.49 and is down 21.93% over 30 days, indicating fading demand for protection as equities grind higher. Equity index futures mirror spot strength, with S&P futures up 0.60%, Nasdaq futures up 0.95%, and Russell futures up 0.71% on the day, extending 30-day gains of roughly 3.3–6.7% and underscoring still-improving risk appetite.
  
  Rates and cross-asset moves point to a moderate rather than euphoric risk-on tone. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat-to-softer on the day (-0.29%) at 4.17% but up 4.22% over 30 days, suggesting some hawkish repricing over the month that has not derailed equities. At the same time, gold (+1.54% 1d, +9.16% 30d) and crude (+1.77% 1d) are firm, while the dollar is slightly higher on the day (+0.21% 1d, -0.52% 30d), pointing to a backdrop where risk appetite is improving but investors are also maintaining hedges via hard assets.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive with 13 assets up versus only 2 down, and the average 1-day index move is a solid +0.73%, led by small caps and growth. Volatility is subdued, with the VIX at 14.49 after a 6.21% drop on the day and nearly 22% lower over 30 days, indicating a calm risk environment. The 10-year yield is stable on the day near 4.17% despite a modest 30-day rise, suggesting higher rates are being digested without immediate stress for equities.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is concentrated in growth, small caps, and cyclicals, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.81%, QQQ up 1.00%, and the Russell 2000 up 0.78%. Over the week, small caps are the clear standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.74%, while the Dow is also strong at +2.35% 7d. On the downside, there are no major equity benchmarks in the red today, but the VIX is a notable decliner at -6.21% 1d, and the US dollar is a modest underperformer over 30 days at -0.52%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and geopolitical themes center on shifting rate expectations and tariff policy risks. Mixed US economic data are influencing Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations, while a recent jobs report helped seal market bets that the Fed will not cut imminently, yet equities still rose according to Yahoo and The Times of India summaries, which is supportive of a risk-on tone. At the same time, a pending US Supreme Court ruling on Trump's emergency tariff powers is highlighted as a key focus, with coverage noting that a ruling against tariffs could potentially boost risk assets, while an adverse outcome might pressure both stocks and bonds, making this a binary risk-on/off catalyst. Global risk sentiment is also being shaped by cross-regional equity and bond moves. Reports note that Asian stocks have been falling as early-2026 optimism fades, even as US Treasuries hold recent gains, reflecting some global risk fatigue outside the US. Additionally, markets are watching the conflict-related backdrop around Venezuela and broader geopolitical tensions, which recent articles link to an earlier rally in US energy, AI, and defense stocks and a generally risk-on start to 2026; this mix of strong US asset performance alongside softer Asia underscores a tape driven by US growth and policy narratives more than synchronized global optimism. Sector and thematic narratives around AI also contribute to the equity tone. Coverage of Snowflake's CEO discussing AI's impact on online search, along with commentary on AI-driven profits and capex from Goldman and AI-related partnerships such as NVIDIA's tie-up with Archer, all point to AI remaining a core support for US growth and tech benchmarks. These stories tend to reinforce a pro-risk bias in large-cap tech and related sectors, even as some analysis warns that long-term AI profits may undershoot current expectations, which could temper the risk-on impulse if earnings later disappoint.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, markets are focused on the US Supreme Court case on Trump's tariff powers, which multiple sources flag as a potential jolt to stocks and bonds depending on the ruling's direction. Asia-Pacific investors are watching China's inflation data, with China CPI in focus and expected to influence regional risk sentiment and, indirectly, global futures. In the US, follow-through from the recent jobs report and any associated commentary on rate expectations will remain in play, especially given articles noting that payrolls data have already shaped Fed cut probabilities. No major single-company earnings are highlighted in the provided data as key near-term catalysts.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity strength (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78% on the day) alongside supportive futures moves (Nasdaq futures +0.95%, Russell futures +0.71%). The VIX is low and falling (-6.21% 1d, 14.49 level), and the 10-year yield eased slightly on the day while remaining manageable, indicating a benign risk backdrop. While the upcoming Supreme Court tariff ruling and global growth data such as China CPI introduce event risk that could swing sentiment either way, the current trend, breadth, and positioning reflected in the metrics tilt the near-term bias toward further upside.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P futures can hold and extend gains above the recent 7,004 close, as well as how the cash S&P 500 behaves around its 6,966 area after a 0.65% daily advance. Nasdaq leadership is important, with Nasdaq futures up 0.95% on the day and the QQQ ETF up 1.00%; sustained strength here would validate the risk-on bias, while any sharp reversal alongside a VIX bounce from 14.49 could signal a short-term sentiment shift. Small caps are another key tell: the Russell 2000, up 4.94% over the week and 6.42% over 30 days, should ideally remain above the 2,600 zone to keep the current breadth and beta leadership intact. On the macro side, attention should be on the US Supreme Court's tariff ruling and its impact on cyclicals, exporters, and rate-sensitive segments, given reports that this decision could meaningfully move both stocks and bonds. Traders should also monitor China's inflation print and any follow-through from recent mixed US data that have shaped Fed cut expectations, especially as the 10-year yield sits near 4.17% after a modest 30-day rise. Cross-asset flows into gold, which is up 1.54% on the day and over 9% in 30 days, and crude, up 1.77% on the day, may also serve as signals of whether the current risk-on environment is broadening into commodities or starting to reflect a more cautious bid for hedges.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

Across equities, the tone is clearly risk-on with broad gains and constructive momentum. The S&P 500 rose 0.65% on the day and 1.02% over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a 0.81% 1d gain and 1.08% over 7d. Small caps are notably strong, with the Russell 2000 up 0.78% on the day, 4.94% over the week, and 6.42% over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite further out the cap spectrum.

Volatility and futures confirm this constructive backdrop. The VIX fell 6.21% on the day to 14.49 and is down 21.93% over 30 days, indicating fading demand for protection as equities grind higher. Equity index futures mirror spot strength, with S&P futures up 0.60%, Nasdaq futures up 0.95%, and Russell futures up 0.71% on the day, extending 30-day gains of roughly 3.3–6.7% and underscoring still-improving risk appetite.

Rates and cross-asset moves point to a moderate rather than euphoric risk-on tone. The 10-year Treasury yield is essentially flat-to-softer on the day (-0.29%) at 4.17% but up 4.22% over 30 days, suggesting some hawkish repricing over the month that has not derailed equities. At the same time, gold (+1.54% 1d, +9.16% 30d) and crude (+1.77% 1d) are firm, while the dollar is slightly higher on the day (+0.21% 1d, -0.52% 30d), pointing to a backdrop where risk appetite is improving but investors are also maintaining hedges via hard assets.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks strong based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is positive with 13 assets up versus only 2 down, and the average 1-day index move is a solid +0.73%, led by small caps and growth.

Over the week, small caps are the clear standout, with the Russell 2000 up 4.94% and Russell futures up 4.74%, while the Dow is also strong at +2.35% 7d. On the downside, there are no major equity benchmarks in the red today, but the VIX is a notable decliner at -6.21% 1d, and the US dollar is a modest underperformer over 30 days at -0.52%.

No major single-company earnings are highlighted in the provided data as key near-term catalysts.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given broad-based equity strength (S&P 500 +0.65%, Nasdaq +0.81%, Russell 2000 +0.78% on the day) alongside supportive futures moves (Nasdaq futures +0.95%, Russell futures +0.71%). The VIX is low and falling (-6.21% 1d, 14.49 level), and the 10-year yield eased slightly on the day while remaining manageable, indicating a benign risk backdrop. While the upcoming Supreme Court tariff ruling and global growth data such as China CPI introduce event risk that could swing sentiment either way, the current trend, breadth, and positioning reflected in the metrics tilt the near-term bias toward further upside.

3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P futures can hold and extend gains above the recent 7,004 close, as well as how the cash S&P 500 behaves around its 6,966 area after a 0.65% daily advance. Nasdaq leadership is important, with Nasdaq futures up 0.95% on the day and the QQQ ETF up 1.00%; sustained strength here would validate the risk-on bias, while any sharp reversal alongside a VIX bounce from 14.49 could signal a short-term sentiment shift. Small caps are another key tell: the Russell 2000, up 4.94% over the week and 6.42% over 30 days, should ideally remain above the 2,600 zone to keep the current breadth and beta leadership intact. On the macro side, attention should be on the US Supreme Court's tariff ruling and its impact on cyclicals, exporters, and rate-sensitive segments, given reports that this decision could meaningfully move both stocks and bonds. Traders should also monitor China's inflation print and any follow-through from recent mixed US data that have shaped Fed cut expectations, especially as the 10-year yield sits near 4.17% after a modest 30-day rise. Cross-asset flows into gold, which is up 1.54% on the day and over 9% in 30 days, and crude, up 1.77% on the day, may also serve as signals of whether the current risk-on environment is broadening into commodities or starting to reflect a more cautious bid for hedges.
