  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-on with a tilt toward cyclicals and small caps. The S&P 500 is up 0.19% on the day and 3.64% over 30 days, while the Dow has gained 0.66% today and 4.97% over 30 days, signaling ongoing strength in large-cap blue chips. The Russell 2000 is a standout with a 1.06% 1d gain and 6.79% over 30 days, indicating improving risk appetite for smaller names despite a -1.98% pullback over the past week.",
      "Volatility and futures confirm a constructive but not euphoric backdrop. The VIX sits at 14.51, down 2.94% on the day and over 41% lower than 30 days ago, pointing to a significant compression in implied risk even though it is up 3.05% over 7 days. Equity futures are modestly higher for the S&P (+0.12% 1d) and Dow (+0.58% 1d), while Nasdaq futures are down 0.28% on the day and 1.19% over the week, suggesting some rotation away from growth/tech leadership.",
      "Rates and cross-asset moves show risk appetite is improving but with some rate headwinds. The 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.58% on the day and 1.55% over 30 days to 4.19, a modest drift higher that has not derailed equities. Gold is slightly softer on the day (-0.26%, -2.93% over 7d) but still up 6.23% over 30 days, while WTI crude is under pressure (-5.63% over 30 days), implying that the current equity bid is more about growth/AI optimism than a broad reflation or commodity-driven risk-on regime."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears moderately strong. Breadth is positive with 9 assets up versus 6 down, and the average 1d index move of roughly +0.31% shows a broad but not extreme advance. A low and falling VIX at 14.51, down nearly 3% today and more than 40% over 30 days, indicates subdued volatility and supportive risk sentiment. The 10Y Treasury yield has edged up to 4.19 but only by about 1.55% over 30 days, suggesting that higher rates are a headwind but not yet destabilizing the equity backdrop.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from domestic cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.06% and Dow 30 up 0.66%, both outpacing the S&P 500's 0.19% gain. Over the week, however, the Russell 2000 (-1.98%) and Russell futures (-2.04%) have lagged, reflecting recent mean reversion after a strong month. On the downside today, tech-heavy benchmarks are the main laggards: the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.03% and QQQ is off 0.19%, while Nasdaq futures are down 0.28%, making growth/tech a relative underperformer on the session.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "The primary macro backdrop highlighted by the news is that Wall Street is starting 2026 after three consecutive years of double-digit gains, which underpins a structurally risk-on tone. Headlines noting that Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures rose as the year kicked off align with the modest gains seen in cash indices and S&P futures (+0.12% 1d), indicating that optimism about continued earnings and economic resilience is supporting equities rather than any specific new policy shock.",
      "Regionally, Asian stock markets are described as bullish at the start of the new year on AI hopes and demand for tech infrastructure, a theme that echoes prior AI-driven gains in U.S. markets. This helps explain why indices like the Nasdaq still show solid 30-day gains (+3.58%) even as they pause today, and it generally favors a risk-on environment tilted toward growth and technology over the medium term. However, today's slight Nasdaq underperformance suggests some profit-taking or rotation within that broader AI-positive narrative.",
      "Broader cross-market commentary points to ongoing enthusiasm in risk assets such as Bitcoin and select AI and retail stocks for 2026, but those are context rather than direct tape drivers in this snapshot. The combination of strong multi-year equity performance, AI optimism, and relatively calm macro headlines (no new major Fed or geopolitical shocks in the provided data) leans toward a constructive risk backdrop. Given that, the current tape looks driven more by positioning and rotation than by any acute risk-off macro or geopolitical catalyst."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence. The bias leans higher because broad U.S. indices are positive on the day (S&P 500 +0.19%, Dow +0.66%, Russell 2000 +1.06%) and equity futures are also modestly higher for the S&P and Dow, indicating underlying buying interest. Volatility is subdued with the VIX at 14.51 and down nearly 3% on the day and over 40% over 30 days, which typically supports incremental upside rather than sharp downside swings. While Nasdaq benchmarks are slightly negative on the day and the 10Y yield is drifting higher, the overall breadth (9 up vs 6 down) and strong small-cap performance suggest dips are being bought, favoring a mild upward bias over the next 24 hours.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Traders should watch whether the rotation into cyclicals and small caps continues, focusing on the Russell 2000 around the 2,500 area and Russell futures near 2,520 as gauges of risk appetite. Sustained outperformance there, alongside a firm Dow around 48,000–48,500, would confirm that investors are embracing a broader rally beyond mega-cap tech. Conversely, any renewed weakness in these segments while Nasdaq futures remain soft would hint at a more selective market rather than a durable risk-on extension.",
      "Monitoring volatility and rates will be critical into the next session. The VIX near 14.5 is a key line in the sand; further compression would support the "grind higher" scenario, while a sharp move back above the recent 7-day uptick zone would challenge the upside bias. On the rates side, watch the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.2%: a controlled move in this area has so far coexisted with equity gains, but a quick push materially above recent 30-day highs could weigh more heavily on growth and Nasdaq-linked products like QQQ and NQ futures, tempering the expected upside."

LLM raw output (truncated): {\n  &quot;1.0&quot;: [\n    &quot;Across equities, the tone is mildly risk-on with a tilt toward cyclicals and small caps. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.19% on the day and 3.64% over 30 days, while the Dow has gained 0.66% today and 4.97% over 30 days, signaling ongoing strength in large-cap blue chips. The Russell 2000 is a standout with a 1.06% 1d gain and 6.79% over 30 days, indicating improving risk appetite for smaller names despite a -1.98% pullback over the past week.&quot;,\n    &quot;Volatility and futures confirm a constructive but not euphoric backdrop. The VIX sits at 14.51, down 2.94% on the day and over 41% lower
