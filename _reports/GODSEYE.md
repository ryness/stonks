  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities ended mixed with a slight negative skew as the S&P 500 dipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.22%. Breadth was modestly positive (9 up vs 6 down), but the average index change was slightly negative at -0.05%, signaling only tentative stabilization rather than broad risk-on.
  
  Volatility eased on the day with VIX down 0.85% to 19.83, yet it remains elevated versus recent history and is up 10.11% over 7 days and 19.10% over 30 days, indicating lingering risk aversion. Futures were mixed to slightly higher (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%, YM -0.58%), and rates firmed as the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%, a headwind for multiples. Netting these, risk appetite improved marginally today but has faded over the week (e.g., Nasdaq Fut -2.33% 7d; Russell Fut -3.00% 7d).
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious-neutral. Breadth at 9 up vs 6 down shows slightly positive participation, but the average index change of -0.05% underscores limited net progress. Elevated volatility (VIX 19.83; +10% over 7d and +19% over 30d) alongside a higher 10Y yield at 4.15% (+0.88% 1d) tempers risk-taking. Overall, conditions look fragile with stabilization attempts meeting tighter financial conditions.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is rotating: on the day, small caps and tech outperformed with the Russell 2000 +0.22% and Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, cyclicals/small caps and tech have led the declines with the Russell 2000 -3.11% and Nasdaq Composite -2.55%, whereas the Dow 30 is the relative standout at -0.35%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Headlines point to a tech-led pullback and concerns over the Chinese economy following what was described as Wall Street’s worst day in a month, framing a risk-off backdrop. This aligns with the 7-day weakness in growth benchmarks (Nasdaq Composite -2.55%, Nasdaq Fut -2.33% 7d) and elevated VIX on a weekly and monthly basis, pressuring sentiment despite today’s modest rebound in tech. Geopolitical and supply-chain tensions around semiconductors surfaced as China voiced “extreme disappointment” with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip row. Such chip-related frictions can weigh on the tech complex and reinforce risk-off tone, consistent with the broader weekly tech underperformance and sustained volatility. Broader corporate headlines like the OxyContin settlement appear idiosyncratic and not primary macro drivers in the current tape. The dominant macro impulses remain tech valuation worries and China-related growth concerns, which align with the week’s drawdowns in risk assets and the persistently elevated VIX.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed price action (S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%) and futures (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%, YM -0.58%) suggests stabilization but not conviction, while VIX is elevated on a 7d/30d basis and the 10Y yield rose 0.88%, capping upside. China and tech-related headlines keep a cautious tone, pointing to a balanced near-term path.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether VIX holds below or reclaims 20 (last 19.83); a push higher would favor risk-off, while continued drift lower would support stabilization. On rates, the 10Y Treasury at 4.15% is pivotal; further backing up in yields would pressure high-duration equities, whereas a pullback could ease equity headwinds. Track equity futures versus their last marks: ES 6,765.25, NQ 25,147.50, YM 47,271.00, and RTY 2,399.00. Sustained strength in NQ and RTY would confirm today’s tentative risk-on rotation, while weakness in YM could continue to flag cyclicals’ drag. Monitor cross-asset signals: WTI crude at 59.95 (+2.15% 1d) and gold at 4,084.40 (-2.45% 1d) alongside the US Dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d). Further oil strength with soft gold and a steady-to-firmer dollar would lean risk-on if rates cooperate; a reversal with rising VIX would reinforce a defensive setup.

**Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-14T22:27:56.966885+00:00">2025-11-14 22:27 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 23s)

## 1. Pulse

Equities ended mixed with a slight negative skew as the S&P 500 dipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.22%. Breadth was modestly positive (9 up vs 6 down), but the average index change was slightly negative at -0.05%, signaling only tentative stabilization rather than broad risk-on.

Volatility eased on the day with VIX down 0.85% to 19.83, yet it remains elevated versus recent history and is up 10.11% over 7 days and 19.10% over 30 days, indicating lingering risk aversion. Futures were mixed to slightly higher (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%, YM -0.58%), and rates firmed as the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% to 4.15%, a headwind for multiples. Netting these, risk appetite improved marginally today but has faded over the week (e.g., Nasdaq Fut -2.33% 7d; Russell Fut -3.00% 7d).

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautious-neutral. Breadth at 9 up vs 6 down shows slightly positive participation, but the average index change of -0.05% underscores limited net progress. Elevated volatility (VIX 19.83; +10% over 7d and +19% over 30d) alongside a higher 10Y yield at 4.15% (+0.88% 1d) tempers risk-taking. Overall, conditions look fragile with stabilization attempts meeting tighter financial conditions.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is rotating: on the day, small caps and tech outperformed with the Russell 2000 +0.22% and Nasdaq Composite +0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, cyclicals/small caps and tech have led the declines with the Russell 2000 -3.11% and Nasdaq Composite -2.55%, whereas the Dow 30 is the relative standout at -0.35%.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Headlines point to a tech-led pullback and concerns over the Chinese economy following what was described as Wall Street’s worst day in a month, framing a risk-off backdrop. This aligns with the 7-day weakness in growth benchmarks (Nasdaq Composite -2.55%, Nasdaq Fut -2.33% 7d) and elevated VIX on a weekly and monthly basis, pressuring sentiment despite today’s modest rebound in tech. Geopolitical and supply-chain tensions around semiconductors surfaced as China voiced “extreme disappointment” with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip row. Such chip-related frictions can weigh on the tech complex and reinforce risk-off tone, consistent with the broader weekly tech underperformance and sustained volatility. Broader corporate headlines like the OxyContin settlement appear idiosyncratic and not primary macro drivers in the current tape. The dominant macro impulses remain tech valuation worries and China-related growth concerns, which align with the week’s drawdowns in risk assets and the persistently elevated VIX.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed price action (S&P 500 -0.05%, Dow -0.65%, Nasdaq +0.13%, Russell +0.22%) and futures (ES +0.08%, NQ +0.21%, RTY +0.38%, YM -0.58%) suggests stabilization but not conviction, while VIX is elevated on a 7d/30d basis and the 10Y yield rose 0.88%, capping upside. China and tech-related headlines keep a cautious tone, pointing to a balanced near-term path.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether VIX holds below or reclaims 20 (last 19.83); a push higher would favor risk-off, while continued drift lower would support stabilization. On rates, the 10Y Treasury at 4.15% is pivotal; further backing up in yields would pressure high-duration equities, whereas a pullback could ease equity headwinds. Track equity futures versus their last marks: ES 6,765.25, NQ 25,147.50, YM 47,271.00, and RTY 2,399.00. Sustained strength in NQ and RTY would confirm today’s tentative risk-on rotation, while weakness in YM could continue to flag cyclicals’ drag. Monitor cross-asset signals: WTI crude at 59.95 (+2.15% 1d) and gold at 4,084.40 (-2.45% 1d) alongside the US Dollar at 99.27 (+0.09% 1d). Further oil strength with soft gold and a steady-to-firmer dollar would lean risk-on if rates cooperate; a reversal with rising VIX would reinforce a defensive setup.
