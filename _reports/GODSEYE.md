  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equity tone is cautiously risk-on, with 3 of 4 major U.S. indices higher on the day and average index performance at about +0.31%. The Dow (+0.66%) and Russell 2000 (+1.06%) are leading, while the Nasdaq is essentially flat (-0.03%), suggesting a mild rotation toward cyclicals and small caps after a softer week where the Nasdaq (-0.82%) and Russell (-1.98%) have lagged. Over 30 days, all majors are up 3.5–6.8%, indicating an intact medium-term uptrend despite minor 7-day pullbacks.","Volatility is supportive of risk-taking, with the VIX down 2.9% on the day to 14.51 and over 40% lower over 30 days, signaling a substantial compression in implied risk premia. S&P and Dow futures are modestly higher (+0.12% and +0.58%), while Nasdaq futures are slightly negative (-0.28%), consistent with today's cash-session tilt away from growth. Overall risk appetite is improving on the day but is somewhat tempered by recent tech softness and small week-over-week index declines.","Rates and cross-asset signals are moderately mixed: the 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.58% on the day and 1.55% over 30 days to 4.19%, showing a gradual grind higher in yields that could cap valuations at the margin. Gold is off 0.26% on the day and nearly -3% on the week despite being up 6.2% over 30 days, while crude is lower across all horizons (1d -0.17%, 30d -5.63%), suggesting easing inflation/commodity pressures. Combined with a slightly firmer dollar on the day (+0.14%), the cross-asset setup points to a constructive but not euphoric risk backdrop, with some rate headwinds offset by low volatility and strong recent equity performance."
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears moderately strong. Breadth is positive with 9 assets up versus 6 down, and the average 1-day index change of roughly +0.31% shows a broad, if modest, advance. Volatility is subdued with the VIX at 14.51 and down sharply over 30 days, indicating contained stress. While the 10Y Treasury yield has edged up to 4.19%, the move is gradual, so the current combination of low vol, positive but not extreme equity gains, and decent breadth suggests a healthy, steady market rather than a late-stage blowoff.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is coming from small caps and the Dow complex, with the Russell 2000 up 1.06% and the Dow 30 up 0.66%, while Russell futures gain 0.98% and Dow futures 0.58%. On the downside, large-cap growth and tech-related benchmarks are lagging, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.03% and QQQ ETF off 0.19%, and Nasdaq futures lower by 0.28%. Over the past week, the Russell 2000 (-1.98%) and Nasdaq (-0.82%) have been notable laggards, whereas the Dow 30 is roughly flat over 7 days (+0.04%), making it a relative near-term leader.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro sentiment is being helped by a constructive tone in Asia, where shares started 2026 on an upbeat note led by a 2–2.4% rally in Hong Kong's Hang Seng and a record high in South Korea's Kospi. This synchronised regional strength, alongside mentions of U.S. futures and oil prices gaining in that context, supports a risk-on environment and aligns with today's modest gains in S&P and Dow futures. The upbeat Asian backdrop reinforces the idea that global growth expectations remain resilient heading into the new year, helping underpin U.S. cyclicals and small caps.","A second theme is portfolio re-positioning and global diversification as investors look into 2026, highlighted by commentary encouraging Indian investors to allocate 10–30% to global assets to access innovation in AI, clean energy, and health. This focus on spreading risk and tapping global growth stories is consistent with a medium-term risk-on stance, even as near-term performance shows some consolidation in tech-heavy benchmarks like the Nasdaq and QQQ. It implies that flows may be rotating across regions and sectors rather than exiting equities altogether, supporting a broader but more selective risk bid."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given today's positive breadth (9 up vs 6 down), average index gains around +0.31%, and supportive volatility backdrop with the VIX down nearly 3% on the day and over 40% in 30 days. S&P and Dow futures are already higher (+0.12% and +0.58%), and small caps are leading with the Russell 2000 up 1.06%, suggesting underlying risk appetite is improving. Slight headwinds from a marginally higher 10Y yield (4.19%) and recent weekly softness in the Nasdaq and Russell temper conviction, but the overall setup still favors a gentle continuation higher rather than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 can build on its recent 30-day advance of 3.64% while holding above the latest close near 6,858, and whether S&P futures can maintain gains from around 6,900.50. The key tell for the risk-on bias will be if the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, up 1.06% and 0.98% today and 6.8–7.1% over 30 days, continue to outperform, confirming that small-cap strength is durable rather than a one-day pop. Sustained VIX levels near the mid-teens (currently 14.51) would further validate an "up" bias by signaling that demand for protection remains subdued.","Sector-wise and style-wise, attention should stay on the divergence between value/cyclicals and growth/tech, with the Dow and Russell leading while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.03% today) and QQQ (-0.19%) lag. If Nasdaq futures, currently down 0.28%, stabilize or turn positive alongside firm Dow and S&P futures, that would point to a broader advance; continued Nasdaq underperformance, by contrast, would imply a more rotational rally favoring industrials, financials, and domestically focused names. On the macro side, monitoring the 10Y yield around 4.19% and crude near $57.32 is important: a further sharp rise in yields or renewed oil strength could pressure valuations and challenge the constructive near-term "up" view, while steady-to-softer yields and contained energy prices would support it."]

Received response from OpenAI.
LLM raw output (truncated): {&quot;1.0&quot;:[&quot;Equity tone is cautiously risk-on, with 3 of 4 major U.S. indices higher on the day and average index performance at about +0.31%. The Dow (+0.66%) and Russell 2000 (+1.06%) are leading, while the Nasdaq is essentially flat (-0.03%), suggesting a mild rotation toward cyclicals and small caps after a softer week where the Nasdaq (-0.82%) and Russell (-1.98%) have lagged. Over 30 days, all majors are up 3.5–6.8%, indicating an intact medium-term uptrend despite minor 7-day pullbacks.&quot;,&quot;Volatility is supportive of risk-taking, with the VIX down 2.9% on the day to 14.51 and over 40% lower
