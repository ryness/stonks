  ## 1. Pulse
  
  [
      "Across US equities, the tone is cautiously risk-on with modest gains and mixed leadership. The S&P 500 is up 0.10% on the day and 0.66% over the week, while the Dow has added 0.07% today and 1.28% over the week, pointing to steady large-cap support. The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.14% on the day but still down 2.83% over 30 days, and the Russell 2000 is flat on the day but up 2.67% over the week and 5.52% over 30 days, signaling improving risk appetite toward small caps despite today's pause.",
      "Volatility is easing from recent stress but remains elevated versus a month ago, suggesting risk appetite has improved in the very short term but is fragile. The VIX is down 1.50% on the day and 6.80% over the week, yet still 39.83% higher over 30 days at 20.29, indicating markets are calmer this week but not back to the low-vol regime. US 10-year yields are drifting lower, with the 10Y down 0.10% on the day and 3.75% over the week to 4.05%, providing a supportive backdrop for risk assets.",
      "Futures indicate a mildly constructive bias despite recent pullbacks, especially in growth-oriented benchmarks. S&P futures are up 0.20% on the day but down 1.13% over the week and 1.00% over 30 days, while Nasdaq futures are up 0.25% today yet down 1.33% over the week and 2.92% over 30 days, reflecting tentative dip-buying after a larger tech correction. Dow futures are modestly higher on the day and positive over 30 days (+0.87%), and Russell futures are flat on the day but up 3.54% over 30 days, collectively pointing to a stabilizing but not emphatically bullish risk tone."
    ]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive with some lingering scars from recent volatility. Breadth shows 10 assets up versus 5 down, and the average 1-day index change is a small gain of about 0.06%, signaling a gentle upward bias rather than a strong rally. Volatility has cooled this week with the VIX down nearly 7% over 7 days, but its 40% jump over 30 days and a level near 20 still flag a more fragile environment than a month ago. The 10Y Treasury yield slipping 3.75% over the week to around 4.05% is supportive for equities, suggesting conditions are healthier than during the recent spike in yields, but not fully normalized.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Nasdaq Composite (+0.14%) and S&P 500 (+0.10%) are modest leaders among US benchmarks, while the Russell 2000 is essentially flat (-0.00%) and QQQ is a notable laggard at -0.10%. On a 1-week basis, the Russell 2000 stands out positively with a 2.67% gain, along with the Dow's 1.28% rise, indicating leadership from small caps and cyclicals. Over the same week, Nasdaq futures (-1.33%) and S&P futures (-1.13%) are relative underperformers, reflecting lingering pressure on growth and tech despite today's slight rebound.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** [
      "Recent macro and geopolitical themes are centered around shifts in global equity leadership and sector rotations, particularly toward India and away from some AI-fear-hit tech segments. Commentary such as Raamdeo Agrawal's view that the next trillion dollars of India's market cap could create outsized wealth, combined with strong rebounds in Indian benchmarks like the Sensex and Nifty after recent selloffs, highlight an underlying global risk-on bias toward emerging markets and structural growth stories. This supports risk appetite globally, even as it may divert some marginal flows away from US large-cap growth toward India and other outperforming regions.",
      "Sector-specific narratives around AI disruption and IT valuations are also driving the tape and influencing global tech risk sentiment. Indian IT stocks, for example, initially sold off on AI-led disruption fears, but then rebounded as Infosys rose 3% on a partnership with Anthropic and as brokers characterized valuations as being in the "value" zone rather than structurally impaired; this type of news leans risk-on for the broader tech complex by reframing AI as an investment and partnership opportunity rather than an existential threat. At the same time, previous broad-based selloffs in Indian markets tied to those AI concerns and weakness in metals, real estate, and other cyclicals show how quickly sentiment can swing back to risk-off when disruption fears or macro worries flare, keeping investors cautious.",
      "Global sentiment has also been buffeted by episodes of broad selloffs tied to "max fear" narratives and then followed by rebounds, as seen in reports of Friday the 13th–style global equity and gold declines amid AI-related worries, and later commentary that such moves might be overdone. This pattern of sharp de-risking followed by buy-the-dip flows contributes to the currently elevated but declining volatility profile in US markets, where the VIX is still nearly 40% higher month-on-month but falling week-on-week. The net effect is a choppy risk environment in which macro and thematic headlines can quickly swing positioning between risk-on and risk-off, even if the underlying data such as easing yields are modestly supportive."
    ]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% Based on the data, the most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up: major US indices are slightly higher on the day, breadth is positive (10 up vs 5 down), and futures across S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow are all green by 0.09–0.25%. Volatility is easing with the VIX down 1.50% on the day and nearly 7% over the week while the 10Y yield continues to drift lower, creating a more supportive macro backdrop. However, the recent 30-day drawdowns in Nasdaq cash and futures (-2.8% to -2.9%) and the still-elevated VIX limit confidence, suggesting gains are likely to be incremental rather than decisive.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** [
      "Traders should monitor whether the S&P 500 and SPY can build on their modest gains, given SPY's 1-day move of +0.16% and S&P futures up 0.20%, as sustained strength here would confirm the tentative risk-on tone. Tech and growth proxies like the Nasdaq Composite (+0.14% today) and QQQ (-0.10% today) warrant close attention, as they remain weak on a 30-day horizon and any renewed downside in Nasdaq futures (currently up 0.25% on the day) could quickly flip the broader tone back to risk-off.",
      "Overnight and into the next session, the interaction between volatility and rates will be key: the VIX remains elevated at 20.29 despite its recent 1-day and 7-day declines, and the 10Y yield around 4.05% has fallen 3.75% over the week, providing a tailwind that markets need to maintain. Traders should also watch small caps via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which are flat on the day but up strongly over 7 and 30 days, as continued relative strength there would reinforce a constructive, cyclical risk-on narrative aligned with the expected "up" bias."

    "Futures indicate a mildly constructive bias despite recent pullbacks, especially in growth-oriented benchmarks. S&P futures are up 0.20% on the day but down 1.13% over the week and 1.00% over 30 days, while Nasdaq futures are up 0.25% today yet down 1.33% over the week and 2.92% over 30 days, reflecting tentative dip-buying after a larger tech correction. Dow futures are modestly higher on the day and positive over 30 days (+0.87%), and Russell futures are flat on the day but up 3.54% over 30 days, collectively pointing to a stabilizing but not emphatically bullish risk tone."

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive with some lingering scars from recent volatility. Breadth shows 10 assets up versus 5 down, and the average 1-day index change is a small gain of about 0.06%, signaling a gentle upward bias rather than a strong rally.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Nasdaq Composite (+0.14%) and S&P 500 (+0.10%) are modest leaders among US benchmarks, while the Russell 2000 is essentially flat (-0.00%) and QQQ is a notable laggard at -0.10%. On a 1-week basis, the Russell 2000 stands out positively with a 2.67% gain, along with the Dow's 1.28% rise, indicating leadership from small caps and cyclicals. Over the same week, Nasdaq futures (-1.33%) and S&P futures (-1.13%) are relative underperformers, reflecting lingering pressure on growth and tech despite today's slight rebound.

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% Based on the data, the most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up: major US indices are slightly higher on the day, breadth is positive (10 up vs 5 down), and futures across S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow are all green by 0.09–0.25%.

Traders should also watch small caps via the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which are flat on the day but up strongly over 7 and 30 days, as continued relative strength there would reinforce a constructive, cyclical risk-on narrative aligned with the expected "up" bias."
