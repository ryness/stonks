  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities the tone is constructive and risk-on, with all four major U.S. benchmarks higher on the day and the S&P 500 up 0.32%, the Dow up 0.60%, the Nasdaq Composite up 0.22%, and the Russell 2000 up 0.27%. Over the last week, gains are broader and stronger, led by the Nasdaq Composite up 2.41% and the Russell 2000 up 0.69%, while the S&P 500 and Dow are up 1.70% and 0.65% respectively, indicating a steady grind higher rather than a blow-off move.","Volatility and futures confirm improving risk appetite, with the VIX down 3.79% on the day and 18.36% over the week to 13.47, while S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are all modestly green on the day and up 1.89%–3.03% over the week. Rates are supportive as the 10Y Treasury yield is down 0.79% on the day and 1.10% on the week to 4.14, signaling easier financial conditions; taken together with 11 up vs 4 down assets in the breadth snapshot and an average 1d index gain of about 0.34%, this points to a firmly risk-on tape with improving, not fading, risk appetite.","Commodities and FX add nuance but do not undermine the risk-on tone: gold futures are up 1.39% on the day and 8.05% over 30 days, WTI crude is up 0.27% on the day and 5.86% on the week, and the U.S. dollar index is slightly softer over 7–30 days. The combination of rising equities, falling volatility, slightly lower yields, and a softer dollar alongside strong gold suggests investors are comfortable taking equity risk while also adding some hedges against macro or policy uncertainty."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is favorable, with 11 instruments up versus 4 down and an average 1d index move of roughly +0.34%, showing gains are not confined to a single benchmark. The VIX sitting at 13.47 after a 3.79% daily and 18.36% weekly decline indicates a calm volatility backdrop supportive of risk-taking. A 10Y yield at 4.14, down about 0.8% on the day and 1.1% on the week, points to slightly easing financial conditions, reinforcing a healthy near-term environment for equities rather than stress.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, the Dow 30 is a notable leader among major U.S. benchmarks with a +0.60% move, while the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 post respectable gains of +0.32% and +0.27% respectively. On a weekly horizon, the Nasdaq Composite stands out on the upside with a +2.41% move, closely followed by QQQ up 2.32% and Nasdaq futures up 3.03%. On the downside, Russell futures are fractionally negative on the day at -0.03%, and there are no major U.S. equity benchmarks with outright losses over the last 24 hours, making small caps via RTY=F the marginal laggard in an otherwise broadly positive tape.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro optimism around U.S. growth is a key driver of the current risk-on tape, as highlighted by reports of 4.3% GDP growth and commentary that the U.S. economy expanded at its fastest pace in two years. Articles noting that U.S. stocks are closing out a third straight year of double-digit gains and that indices are hovering near or at record highs reinforce a narrative of resilient growth and strong corporate profits, which supports higher equity prices and lower volatility.","Policy and liquidity expectations are another important theme, with coverage emphasizing anticipated Fed rate cuts and a generally dovish backdrop as prerequisites for continued equity strength into 2026. References to Washington aiming a "cash bazooka" at banks and consumers and to markets riding a "Santa Claus rally" into the Christmas holiday contribute to the perception of ample liquidity and supportive policy, encouraging a risk-on stance across equities and compressing the VIX.","AI and technology spending, along with strong performance in select growth names, also feature prominently in the news flow and help explain leadership in Nasdaq-linked benchmarks. Stories about AI spending, Nvidia's role as a proxy for AI exposure, and tech and AI names leading recent U.S. stock gains frame the current move as growth- and innovation-driven; this tends to favor Nasdaq and QQQ outperformance and sustains risk appetite, even as some voices warn about bubbles or sector-specific corrections, which could introduce pockets of volatility without derailing the broader risk-on bias evident in the indices."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term market-moving events in the next 24 hours are only indirectly referenced, so timing is imprecise, but several items could still influence sentiment. Continued digestion of the recent 4.3% U.S. GDP report and related commentary will shape expectations for growth, inflation, and Fed policy, affecting both equities and Treasury yields. Holiday-thinned trading conditions, including shortened sessions in Europe and parts of Asia, may amplify any moves in response to incremental headlines on economic growth, AI spending, or policy expectations. There is also focus on upcoming inflation data in other regions (such as ABS inflation in Australia) that, while not U.S.-specific, can influence global risk appetite and spill over into U.S. futures in thin overnight trade.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, supported by broad-based equity gains today (average index change around +0.34%), strong 7d moves in the Nasdaq (+2.41%) and S&P 500 (+1.70%), and futures that are slightly positive on the day and solidly higher over the week. The VIX's sharp 18.36% weekly drop to 13.47 and a 10Y yield that is lower on both a 1d and 7d basis signal a benign macro and volatility backdrop that typically favors incremental equity upside. News flow emphasizing record highs in the Dow and S&P 500, strong U.S. GDP growth, and supportive policy/liquidity narratives (Santa Claus rally, expectations for Fed cuts) also tilts the bias to risk-on, though holiday-thin volumes argue for only moderate conviction rather than a high-confidence call.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether S&P 500 levels near the recent record area around 6,900–6,950 on cash and 6,950–7,000 on ES futures can hold and extend, as sustained trading above those zones would confirm the current breakout narrative. Monitoring the VIX around the low-teens handle (near 13–14) will be important; continued stability or further compression would validate the up-bias, while any abrupt spike back toward the mid-teens could signal a short-term shift toward risk-off despite the positive tape.","Sector-wise, attention should stay on growth and AI-linked tech, reflected in Nasdaq Composite and QQQ performance, as news flow continues to highlight AI spending and tech leadership, with Nasdaq futures up about 3.03% over the week. At the same time, traders should track small-cap behavior via the Russell 2000 index and Russell futures, where 30d gains of 3.65%–4.28% show improving risk appetite but today's slight dip in RTY=F (-0.03% 1d) hints at some hesitation; sustained small-cap participation would support further upside. On the macro side, watch the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.1% and any follow-on reaction to strong U.S. growth headlines, as a renewed backup in yields from here could temper the equity bid, while stable or lower yields would underpin the expected modestly higher move."]
