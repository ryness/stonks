  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Across equities, the tone is constructive with a clear risk-on tilt over the last session. The S&P 500 rose 0.84%, the Dow 0.63%, the Nasdaq Composite 1.22%, and the Russell 2000 1.44%, with average index gains around 1.0%. This rebound comes despite modestly negative 7-day returns for the large-cap indices, suggesting risk appetite is improving tactically after recent consolidation.","Volatility is easing in the short term, reinforcing the risk-on message. The VIX fell 6.46% on the day and 6.82% over the week, even though it remains roughly 27% higher than 30 days ago at 18.98, indicating that while immediate fear is receding, the medium-term volatility regime is still elevated relative to a month ago. This combination points to stabilizing sentiment but not full complacency.","Futures mirror the cash market's constructive tone. S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures are up 0.85%, 1.24%, 0.67%, and 1.41% respectively over the last day, while the 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day (+0.03 to 4.08%) and down about 3% over the week. Slightly lower yields over 7–30 days alongside rising equities and easing near-term volatility indicate an improving but still cautious risk appetite."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health appears solidly positive in the short term. Breadth is strong, with 14 assets up and only 1 down, and the average 1-day index gain is just over 1%, showing broad participation across benchmarks. The VIX dropping more than 6% on the day, combined with a 10Y yield that is roughly 3% lower than a week ago, suggests a friendlier macro backdrop for risk assets. Overall, conditions look healthier than a week ago, though the VIX's 27% rise over 30 days signals that underlying macro uncertainty has not fully cleared.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is coming from growth and small caps, with the Nasdaq Composite up 1.22% and the Russell 2000 up 1.44% over the last day, and QQQ gaining 1.15%. On the downside, there are no major U.S. benchmarks in the red on a 1-day basis, but laggards in a relative sense include the Dow 30 at +0.63% and SPY at +0.78%, which are trailing the higher-beta indices. Over the past week, the Russell 2000 stands out positively at +0.54% while the Nasdaq Composite lags at -0.77%, underscoring recent pressure in tech versus resilience in small caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Recent macro and geopolitical tape is dominated by alternating risk-off and recovery swings in global equities, particularly in India, which provide context for broader sentiment. Articles highlight a sharp selloff across sectors, especially IT and metals, on February 13 amid AI disruption concerns and broad risk-off behavior, followed by strong rebounds in Sensex and Nifty on February 16 and subsequent sessions as volatility eased and buy-on-dips strategies emerged. This pattern of fast de-risking followed by aggressive dip-buying is consistent with today's U.S. risk-on tone and supports a bias toward renewed, but tactical, risk-taking.","Sector-specific and stock-specific themes around AI are also shaping risk appetite. Indian and global reports note sustained weakness in IT stocks tied to fears of AI-led disruption, even as some voices argue the selloff is overdone and that strong balance sheets will allow firms to invest in AI-related growth. At the same time, a notable 40% surge in Raspberry Pi shares on AI-related optimism and insider buying underscores that AI remains a powerful positive catalyst for select hardware and tech names, creating a mixed but active backdrop where AI can drive both risk-off in incumbents and risk-on in perceived beneficiaries.","More broadly, commentary around global "panic" indicators and prior selloffs in stocks and gold, followed by subsequent rallies, suggests that macro risk sentiment is still sensitive to headlines but quick to mean-revert. Coverage of global selloffs linked to AI fears and later stabilization, alongside discussion of strong economic growth in some political commentary, points to a market that is oscillating between fear and confidence rather than trending decisively in one direction. This underpins a tape where macro narratives can abruptly swing positioning, but the current session's data show that the pendulum has swung back toward risk-on for now."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete forward-looking events in the next 24 hours are not specified in the provided data, so specific earnings releases, economic data prints, or policy decisions that could move the market are unknown.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up. Major U.S. indices gained 0.6–1.4% today with futures similarly higher, breadth is strongly positive (14 up, 1 down), and the VIX fell over 6%, pointing to improving risk appetite. The 10Y yield is slightly higher on the day but lower over the past week and month, suggesting no acute rates shock, while global headlines show recent risk-off episodes being met with buy-the-dip behavior. Together, these factors tilt the near-term bias toward continued, though likely incremental, upside rather than a sharp reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether key U.S. equity benchmarks can build on today's gains, particularly the Nasdaq Composite and Russell 2000, which led with 1.22% and 1.44% advances, respectively. Maintaining strength in futures (S&P +0.85%, Nasdaq +1.24%, Russell +1.41%) into the overnight session would validate the risk-on bias, while any sharp reversal accompanied by a VIX bounce from 18.98 back above the 20 area would signal a potential fade in sentiment. Monitoring the 10Y yield around 4.08% is also important; a renewed push higher toward recent highs would challenge the equity rally, whereas stability or further softening would support it.","Given AI-related volatility highlighted in global news, traders should pay close attention to tech and IT-linked names and ETFs like QQQ, as well as small caps via the Russell 2000 and RTY futures, which have been outperforming over 7–30 days. Sustained leadership in these higher-beta segments would confirm a constructive risk-on rotation, especially if accompanied by continued strength in pro-cyclical commodities like WTI crude (+3.02% on the day) and gold (+2.84%). Conversely, underperformance in tech or small caps relative to the S&P 500, or a narrowing of breadth from today's 14 up / 1 down profile, would be an early warning that the short-term up bias is stalling."]

["Across equities, the tone is constructive with a clear risk-on tilt over the last session. The S&P 500 rose 0.84%, the Dow 0.63%, the Nasdaq Composite 1.22%, and the Russell 2000 1.44%, with average index gains around 1.0%. This rebound comes despite modestly negative 7-day returns for the large-cap indices, suggesting risk appetite is improving tactically after recent consolidation.","Volatility is easing in the short term, reinforcing the risk-on message.
