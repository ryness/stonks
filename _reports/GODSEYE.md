  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone, as all major US indices posted gains of roughly 0.35–1.16% on the day and the average index move was about +0.63%. Small caps led with the Russell 2000 up 1.16% and its futures up 2.64%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.64% and 0.52%, respectively, pointing to broad participation. This suggests risk appetite is improving on a 1-day basis despite mild losses over the past week (around -0.3% to -1.2% across the main indices).","Volatility is firmly lower, reinforcing the constructive tone: the VIX fell 5.6% on the day and is down over 26% in 30 days to 14.1, consistent with a compressed risk premium. Equity futures are even stronger than the cash indices, with S&P futures up 1.99%, Nasdaq futures up 2.31%, and Russell futures up 2.64% on the session, signaling investors are adding exposure into the next session rather than fading the rally. This combination of higher equities and lower implied volatility indicates a meaningful uptick in risk appetite versus recent weeks.","Rates are mildly higher but not enough to derail the risk bid: the 10Y Treasury yield is up 1.86% over 30 days and 0.44% on the day to about 4.17%, a modest backup that equities are currently absorbing. The softer US dollar (DXY -0.43% on the day, -1.43% over 30 days) alongside strong gold (+3.5% on the day, +12.9% over 30 days) and firmer oil (+2.15% on the day) point to a pro-cyclical, reflation-friendly mix where risk appetite is improving but investors are also paying up for hard assets. The net cross-asset picture is risk-on with a tilt toward cyclical and small-cap beta, tempered by a parallel bid in commodities."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive based on today's benchmark changes. Breadth is strong, with 13 assets up and only 2 down, and the average 1-day index gain of roughly +0.63% shows the move is not narrowly driven. Volatility is compressing, as the VIX dropped another 5.6% to roughly 14, while equities rallied, indicating improving sentiment rather than stress. The slight rise in the 10Y yield to about 4.17% has not yet impaired risk, so overall conditions look healthy but dependent on rates remaining contained.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in small caps and cyclicals, with the Russell 2000 up 1.16% and Russell futures up 2.64%, making the Russell a standout gainer. On the downside, there are no major equity benchmarks in the red on the day, but within the pack the QQQ ETF is a relative laggard at only +0.35% while the Dow 30 gained 0.47%. Over the past week, QQQ is also a notable underperformer at -1.02% versus the S&P 500 ETF SPY at -0.34%, while the Russell 2000 is down 1.23%, marking small caps and tech as the weaker spots on a 7-day view despite today's rebound.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro themes are dominated by a global risk-on push tied to hopes of a year-end rally, with Asian equity markets "poised for a positive open" as they track recent US gains, according to the Asian markets wrap. This is reinforced by reports that US stocks recently rose for a third straight day, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching sizeable advances, which fits with today's S&P 500 (+0.64%) and Nasdaq (+0.52%) gains and stronger futures. These dynamics collectively support a risk-on backdrop as investors position for a stronger finish to the year.","Monetary policy developments in Japan are another key driver, as news notes that Asian stocks rallied while the Bank of Japan raised rates to a three-decade high, with the yen easing and risk appetite lifting in Asia and in crypto. Related coverage highlights that S&P 500 futures are gaining on rate-cut hopes elsewhere even as global bond yields rise after the BOJ move, aligning with today's modest uptick in the US 10Y yield to about 4.17% alongside firm S&P futures (+1.99%). This suggests investors are treating central bank actions as manageable and ultimately supportive of risk assets, sustaining a risk-on tone.","Geopolitically and in commodities, rising oil prices and a strong move in gold are tied in the headlines to factors like US policy moves affecting tankers off Venezuela and broader uncertainty around trade and economic blocs. The 2.15% rise in WTI crude and 3.5% jump in gold futures, combined with a weaker US dollar (-0.43% on the day), indicate markets are hedging policy and geopolitical risks through hard assets even as they add equity risk. Netting these themes, the impact is mixed—commodities and gold strength can be a mild risk-off hedge—but the equity and futures response remains skewed to risk-on."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Key triggers over the next 24 hours include macro and policy events highlighted in the news flow rather than specific scheduled US data. Markets are watching ongoing reactions to the recent Bank of Japan rate hike and the associated moves in global bond yields, which could influence risk appetite and cross-asset volatility. Additionally, traders will monitor follow-through on the year-end rally narrative in Asia and Europe as they open, as well as any policy headlines around trade, oil (after the move in tankers off Venezuela noted in recent coverage), and central-bank communication that might alter expectations for 2026. Corporate earnings references, such as upcoming reports like Darden Restaurants in the broader news set, are stock-specific and unlikely to shift the macro tape materially but could affect sentiment at the margin.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up, 65% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is modestly up, as all major US indices advanced today (S&P 500 +0.64%, Nasdaq +0.52%, Russell 2000 +1.16%) and futures show even stronger gains (S&P +1.99%, Nasdaq +2.31%, Russell +2.64%), indicating demand is extending into the next session. Breadth is strong (13 up vs 2 down) and the VIX is down 5.6% on the day and 26% over 30 days, signaling compressed risk premia and supportive positioning. While the 10Y yield has drifted higher to roughly 4.17%, equities have absorbed the move so far, and global headlines emphasize year-end rally hopes and improving Asian risk appetite, which align with a continuation of the current risk-on trend rather than an abrupt reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Into the next session, traders should watch whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can build on today's gains and hold the strength implied by futures, especially with S&P futures already up 1.99% and Nasdaq futures up 2.31%. Monitoring the Russell 2000 and Russell futures, which are leading on both a 1-day and 30-day basis (cash +1.16% today and +5.18% over 30 days; futures +2.64% today and +5.54% over 30 days), will be important to confirm that small-cap and cyclical leadership persists, as this is central to the current risk-on tone.","On the macro side, focus should stay on the 10Y Treasury yield near 4.17% and the VIX around 14: a sharp backup in yields or a reversal higher in volatility would challenge the bullish bias and could truncate the rally. Traders should also track gold and oil after their strong moves (gold +3.5%, WTI +2.15% today) for any signs that hedging demand is intensifying, as well as overnight action in Asian and European equity futures tied to the year-end rally narrative and the recent Bank of Japan rate hike; sustained strength there would support the constructive bias for US markets into the next session."]

## 1. Pulse

["Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone, as all major US indices posted gains of roughly 0.35–1.16% on the day and the average index move was about +0.63%. Small caps led with the Russell 2000 up 1.16% and its futures up 2.64%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.64% and 0.52%, respectively, pointing to broad participation. This suggests risk appetite is improving on a 1-day basis despite mild losses over the past week (around -0.3% to -1.2% across the main indices).","Volatility is firmly lower, reinforcing the constructive tone: the VIX fell 5.6% on the day and is down over 26% in 30 days to 14.1, consistent with a compressed risk premium. Equity futures are even stronger than the cash indices, with S&P futures up 1.99%, Nasdaq futures up 2.31%, and Russell futures up 2.64% on the session, signaling investors are adding exposure into the next session rather than fading the rally.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up, 65% – The most likely direction in the next 24 hours is modestly up, as all major US indices advanced today (S&P 500 +0.64%, Nasdaq +0.52%, Russell 2000 +1.16%) and futures show even stronger gains (S&P +1.99%, Nasdaq +2.31%, Russell +2.64%), indicating demand is extending into the next session. Breadth is strong (13 up vs 2 down) and the VIX is down 5.6% on the day and 26% over 30 days, signaling compressed risk premia and supportive positioning. While the 10Y yield has drifted higher to roughly 4.17%, equities have absorbed the move so far, and global headlines emphasize year-end rally hopes and improving Asian risk appetite, which align with a continuation of the current risk-on trend rather than an abrupt reversal.
