  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities closed mixed with a slightly negative tilt, as the average index change was -0.049% and breadth showed 9 up vs 6 down. The S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% and the Russell 2000 rose 0.22%, indicating selective buying rather than broad risk-on. On a 7-day view, risk appetite has faded with the S&P 500 down 0.91%, the Nasdaq off 2.55%, and the Russell 2000 down 3.11%.
  
  Volatility is steady on the day but higher on a trend basis, with VIX at 19.98 (-0.10% 1d) yet up 10.94% over the week and 20.00% over 30 days, signaling lingering caution. Futures lean modestly positive excluding the Dow: S&P futures +0.06%, Nasdaq futures +0.16%, Russell futures +0.30%, and Dow futures -0.62%, suggesting a tentative stabilization rather than a decisive shift in risk appetite.
  
  Rates firmed as the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% to 4.15, the US Dollar edged up 0.10%, gold fell 2.46%, and WTI crude gained 2.18%. The combination of firmer yields and a weekly rise in volatility, alongside mixed equity performance, points to constrained risk appetite despite today’s modest stabilization in select risk assets.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously neutral to soft. Breadth was slightly positive at 9 up vs 6 down, but the average index change of -0.049% shows a near-flat drift lower. Elevated volatility on a weekly basis (VIX +10.94% w/w to 19.98) paired with a firmer 10Y yield (+0.88% 1d to 4.15) tempers the tone. Overall, the setup reflects stabilization after recent weakness rather than a robust recovery.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, small caps and growth underperformed, with the Russell 2000 down 3.11% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.55%, while the Dow 30 held up best at -0.35%. Notably, QQQ rose 0.08% today while SPY slipped 0.02%, underscoring the day’s relative tech resilience versus broader large caps.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment remains pressured by reports of a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy following an unprecedented slump in investment in China, which the coverage links to Wall Street’s worst day in a month. This backdrop aligns with the week’s weaker equity tape (Nasdaq -2.55% w/w, Russell 2000 -3.11% w/w) and higher VIX on the week (+10.94%), reinforcing a risk-off bias toward growth-sensitive assets. Semiconductor supply chain tensions are in focus after China voiced “extreme disappointment” with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip row, framed as a wake-up call for western leaders. Such headlines can weigh on tech sentiment, consistent with the Nasdaq’s negative 7-day move (-2.38% for Nasdaq futures), keeping risk appetite muted despite today’s small bounce in tech benchmarks. Trade policy headlines included a reported US deal to cut tariffs on Swiss goods to 15%, which could be marginally risk-on for affected segments, though the broader market tone remains dominated by tech and China concerns. With volatility elevated on a weekly basis and rates firmer, the net effect skews toward cautious positioning rather than broad risk-taking.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed signals dominate: on the day, S&P (-0.05%) and Dow (-0.65%) were offset by gains in Nasdaq (+0.13%) and Russell (+0.22%), breadth was 9/6, and futures are modestly positive ex-Dow (ES +0.06%, NQ +0.16%, RTY +0.30%) while VIX is flat on the day but up 10.94% over the week and the 10Y yield rose 0.88%. Coupled with risk-off headlines around China and tech, the most likely outcome is a sideways session with limited directional follow-through.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures versus recent closes: ES around 6,764, NQ near 25,134, RTY near 2,397, and YM near 47,252 for confirmation of stabilization or renewed weakness. A sustained bid in ES and NQ alongside a firm RTY would support a flat-to-stable tone; a break lower in YM or RTY would warn that cyclicals and small caps are reasserting downside leadership. Monitor volatility and rates as risk toggles: VIX near the 20 level (last 19.98) and the 10Y yield around 4.15 are key thresholds for equity risk appetite. A drift lower in VIX with stable-to-softer yields would favor resilience, while a push above 20 in VIX or further yield firmness would challenge any bounce attempts. Keep an eye on tech and semiconductor sentiment given the chip-supply headlines, alongside small caps which have led recent downside on a weekly basis (Russell 2000 -3.11% w/w). Also track commodities for cross-asset cues: oil strength (WTI +2.18% 1d) versus gold weakness (-2.46% 1d) can inform risk tone if trends persist.

## 1. Pulse

Equities closed mixed with a slightly negative tilt, as the average index change was -0.049% and breadth showed 9 up vs 6 down. The S&P 500 slipped 0.05% and the Dow fell 0.65%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.13% and the Russell 2000 rose 0.22%, indicating selective buying rather than broad risk-on. On a 7-day view, risk appetite has faded with the S&P 500 down 0.91%, the Nasdaq off 2.55%, and the Russell 2000 down 3.11%.

Volatility is steady on the day but higher on a trend basis, with VIX at 19.98 (-0.10% 1d) yet up 10.94% over the week and 20.00% over 30 days, signaling lingering caution. Futures lean modestly positive excluding the Dow: S&P futures +0.06%, Nasdaq futures +0.16%, Russell futures +0.30%, and Dow futures -0.62%, suggesting a tentative stabilization rather than a decisive shift in risk appetite.

Rates firmed as the 10Y Treasury yield rose 0.88% to 4.15, the US Dollar edged up 0.10%, gold fell 2.46%, and WTI crude gained 2.18%. The combination of firmer yields and a weekly rise in volatility, alongside mixed equity performance, points to constrained risk appetite despite today’s modest stabilization in select risk assets.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is cautiously neutral to soft. Breadth was slightly positive at 9 up vs 6 down, but the average index change of -0.049% shows a near-flat drift lower. Elevated volatility on a weekly basis (VIX +10.94% w/w to 19.98) paired with a firmer 10Y yield (+0.88% 1d to 4.15) tempers the tone. Overall, the setup reflects stabilization after recent weakness rather than a robust recovery.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to growth and small caps on the day, with the Russell 2000 up 0.22% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.13%, while the Dow 30 lagged at -0.65%. Over the week, small caps and growth underperformed, with the Russell 2000 down 3.11% and the Nasdaq Composite down 2.55%, while the Dow 30 held up best at -0.35%. Notably, QQQ rose 0.08% today while SPY slipped 0.02%, underscoring the day’s relative tech resilience versus broader large caps.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Global risk sentiment remains pressured by reports of a tech sell-off and fears over the Chinese economy following an unprecedented slump in investment in China, which the coverage links to Wall Street’s worst day in a month. This backdrop aligns with the week’s weaker equity tape (Nasdaq -2.55% w/w, Russell 2000 -3.11% w/w) and higher VIX on the week (+10.94%), reinforcing a risk-off bias toward growth-sensitive assets. Semiconductor supply chain tensions are in focus after China voiced “extreme disappointment” with a Dutch minister at the center of a car chip row, framed as a wake-up call for western leaders. Such headlines can weigh on tech sentiment, consistent with the Nasdaq’s negative 7-day move (-2.38% for Nasdaq futures), keeping risk appetite muted despite today’s small bounce in tech benchmarks. Trade policy headlines included a reported US deal to cut tariffs on Swiss goods to 15%, which could be marginally risk-on for affected segments, though the broader market tone remains dominated by tech and China concerns. With volatility elevated on a weekly basis and rates firmer, the net effect skews toward cautious positioning rather than broad risk-taking.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed signals dominate: on the day, S&P (-0.05%) and Dow (-0.65%) were offset by gains in Nasdaq (+0.13%) and Russell (+0.22%), breadth was 9/6, and futures are modestly positive ex-Dow (ES +0.06%, NQ +0.16%, RTY +0.30%) while VIX is flat on the day but up 10.94% over the week and the 10Y yield rose 0.88%. Coupled with risk-off headlines around China and tech, the most likely outcome is a sideways session with limited directional follow-through.

3.2. **Watch List:** Watch index futures versus recent closes: ES around 6,764, NQ near 25,134, RTY near 2,397, and YM near 47,252 for confirmation of stabilization or renewed weakness. A sustained bid in ES and NQ alongside a firm RTY would support a flat-to-stable tone; a break lower in YM or RTY would warn that cyclicals and small caps are reasserting downside leadership. Monitor volatility and rates as risk toggles: VIX near the 20 level (last 19.98) and the 10Y yield around 4.15 are key thresholds for equity risk appetite. A drift lower in VIX with stable-to-softer yields would favor resilience, while a push above 20 in VIX or further yield firmness would challenge any bounce attempts. Keep an eye on tech and semiconductor sentiment given the chip-supply headlines, alongside small caps which have led recent downside on a weekly basis (Russell 2000 -3.11% w/w). Also track commodities for cross-asset cues: oil strength (WTI +2.18% 1d) versus gold weakness (-2.46% 1d) can inform risk tone if trends persist.
