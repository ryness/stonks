  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are modestly firmer with a clear but measured risk-on tone. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq are up 0.19%, 0.22%, and 0.31% on the day, while the Russell 2000 is the only major index down at -0.38%. On a 7-day basis, all four benchmarks are higher between roughly 1.5% and 2.4%, indicating risk appetite has been improving over the past week even if today's gains are incremental.","Volatility continues to ease, reinforcing the constructive risk backdrop. The VIX is down 2.35% on the day and nearly 17% over the week to 15.41, a level consistent with calm equity conditions and supportive of carry and short-vol strategies. Equity futures echo this tone: S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are up 0.17%, 0.43%, and 0.18% on the day, while Russell futures are softer at -0.44%, suggesting ongoing preference for large-cap growth over small caps.","In rates, the 10-year Treasury yield has edged higher by 3–4% over both 7 and 30 days to 4.14%, implying a slow backing up in yields rather than a sharp flight to safety. The combination of rising yields with rising equities and falling volatility indicates investors are leaning toward a growth and "soft landing" narrative, with risk appetite clearly improved versus a month ago despite some duration headwinds."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately strong. Breadth is positive with 11 assets up versus 4 down, and the average 1-day index change is +0.16%, showing a broad, if shallow, advance rather than a narrow melt-up. Volatility is subdued with the VIX at 15.41 and down 10.9% over 30 days, pointing to a stable risk environment. The main caution is a 10Y yield up 3.7% over the month to 4.14%, which tightens financial conditions somewhat but has not yet derailed the equity uptrend.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is concentrated in large-cap growth and tech-linked benchmarks. On the day, the Nasdaq Composite is a standout among indices at +0.31% and QQQ is up 0.41%, outperforming the S&P 500 (+0.19%) and Dow (+0.22%). On the downside, small caps are lagging: the Russell 2000 is off -0.38% and Russell futures are down -0.44% on the session, making them the clear short-term underperformers despite solid 7-day gains above 2%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro data and inflation dynamics are a key driver, with headlines noting that "stocks finish higher as price pressures ease." This aligns with the broad equity gains and falling VIX, as moderating price pressures support expectations that central banks can remain on or move toward a less restrictive stance, fostering a risk-on backdrop and enabling multiple expansion, particularly in growth and tech sectors.","Energy markets are being supported by a mix of geopolitical tensions and economic optimism, as crude is up 0.69% on the day and 3.68% over the week. According to reported commentary, crude and gasoline are buoyed by those geopolitical risks and upbeat demand expectations, which can be mildly risk-on for equities tied to energy and cyclicals but also imply a potential floor under input costs that could complicate the inflation outlook if the move in oil extends.","Crypto-related news flow shows heightened volatility and conflicting sentiment, with one piece highlighting downside risks to Bitcoin from quantum and leverage concerns while others emphasize renewed risk-on moves and institutional interest. While these are mostly sector-specific, they illustrate a broader environment where speculative assets can swing with changing liquidity and policy expectations; for traditional markets, this tends to reinforce that risk appetite is present but selective, favoring more established benchmarks over the most volatile corners of the market."
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term market-moving events are not specified in the provided data, though third-party headlines reference an upcoming Fed decision and inflation data in general terms without precise timing. As no explicit calendar of the next 24 hours' earnings, economic releases, or policy events is given in the structured data, the specific upcoming triggers cannot be determined. Therefore, the exact drivers over the next day are unknown based on this dataset.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, given that major indices (S&P 500 +0.19%, Nasdaq +0.31%, Dow +0.22%) and corresponding futures (ES +0.17%, NQ +0.43%, YM +0.18%) are all in positive territory, and the VIX is down sharply over both 1 day and 7 days. Easing price pressures cited in the news support a constructive macro narrative, and breadth is positive with 11 assets up versus 4 down. The main offsetting factor is the gradual rise in 10Y yields and clear small-cap underperformance, which tempers confidence and argues for only a grind higher rather than a strong rally.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should monitor whether the large-cap growth leadership persists, focusing on Nasdaq levels and QQQ's ability to hold its recent 0.41% daily gain and 2.72% advance over the past week. Sustained strength in Nasdaq futures (+0.43% on the day) relative to Russell futures (-0.44%) would confirm the current style bias toward mega-cap tech and high-quality growth at the expense of small caps.","On the macro side, the 10Y Treasury yield at 4.14% and rising roughly 3.4% over the week is a key pressure point; if yields push noticeably higher, it could challenge equity valuations despite the currently low VIX. In commodities, WTI crude near $60 and up 3.68% on the week, along with gold's steady climb, should be watched for any acceleration that might signal shifting inflation expectations and a change in the risk-on tone implied by today's softer volatility and firm equities."]
