  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Across equities, the tone is clearly risk-on with all major U.S. benchmarks up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–4.2% over the past week, while small caps in the Russell 2000 have surged 6.5% over 7 days. ETFs mirror this strength, with SPY up 0.55% and QQQ up 0.81% on the day, indicating broad participation with a growth tilt and improving risk appetite. The average 1d index gain of about 0.62% and 12 up vs 3 down in the breadth snapshot confirm a constructive tape.
  
  Volatility and rates are reinforcing this supportive backdrop. The VIX is down 4.9% on the day and almost 34% over the week to 16.35, signaling a sharp compression in hedging demand as equity indices rally. The 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day at 4.02% (+0.48% 1d) but has eased 2.6% over the week, suggesting rate pressure has not been an impediment to equities and is moderately supportive of risk.
  
  Futures pricing is even more bullish than spot, highlighting strong near-term risk appetite. S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are all up roughly 2.1–2.6% on the day, and Russell futures stand out with a 3.6% 1d jump and 4.6% gain over the week, despite being flat over 30 days. This combination of strong equity and futures gains, falling volatility, and stable-to-softer yields indicates risk appetite is improving meaningfully rather than fading, with multi-asset confirmation from gold’s 3.1% 1d rise and a slightly softer dollar.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health screens as strong based on the benchmark changes. The average 1d index move is about +0.62%, and breadth shows 12 instruments up versus only 3 down, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow mega-cap rally. Volatility has compressed sharply, with the VIX down nearly 34% over the week to 16.35, while the 10Y yield is modestly lower over 7 days, reducing rate headwinds. Taken together, the mix of positive breadth, moderate index gains, and a calmer volatility and Treasury backdrop suggests a relatively healthy risk environment.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and cyclicals via QQQ (+0.81%) and the Russell 2000 (+0.58% cash, +3.57% on Russell futures), with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.65%. On a weekly basis, small caps are clear standouts, with the Russell 2000 up 6.46% versus 3.5–4.2% for the large-cap indices. On the downside, the main laggards are in commodities: WTI crude is off 0.49% on the day and down 2.56% over the week, while the U.S. dollar is slightly weaker on the day (-0.14%) and week (-0.09%), underscoring that leadership is centered in equities rather than in defensives or energy.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and trading-structure factors around the U.S. holiday period are influencing today’s tape. U.S. markets operated on an early Black Friday close, and a CME Group outage tied to a data centre cooling failure temporarily halted futures trading, which can distort intraday liquidity and price discovery. Despite that disruption, the end-state was constructive, with U.S. stock futures and cash indices closing solidly in the green, indicating that the outage was a transient operational issue rather than a risk-off macro shock. Rate expectations and associated policy narratives are also in the backdrop, supporting a risk-on tone. Recent coverage notes that Fed commentary and weak data have boosted global rate-cut hopes, and the U.S. 10Y yield has drifted about 2.6% lower over the week even as equities climbed 3.5–4.2%, which is a classic risk-supportive combination. The concurrent drop in the VIX by roughly a third over the week suggests investors are growing more comfortable with the macro path, treating softer yields and dovish-leaning signals as catalysts for adding equity and growth exposure. Sector and cross-asset flows hint at a blend of risk-on positioning and some hedging via hard assets. Pre-market commentary highlighted strong gains in U.S. futures and specific growth names, while gold futures jumped 3.1% on the day and over 3.2% on the week, pointing to persistent demand for protection against macro or geopolitical uncertainty. At the same time, WTI crude’s 2.6% weekly decline and the mildly weaker dollar indicate that energy and FX are not the primary drivers of current equity strength, leaving monetary policy expectations and year-end positioning as the dominant tape themes in risk terms.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The next 24 hours are likely to be driven by the full reopening of U.S. markets after the Black Friday early close, plus any scheduled U.S. economic data and Fed-related commentary referenced in pre-market coverage, such as employment or inflation prints and policy speeches; these can shift rate-cut expectations and thus equity risk appetite. In addition, any follow-up communication from CME Group or exchanges regarding the recent futures outage could influence confidence in futures liquidity, though the impact so far has been limited. Earnings-specific catalysts are not highlighted in the provided data, so macro releases and policy rhetoric remain the key near-term triggers.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence. Broad-based equity strength over the last day and week, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–4.2% on the week and the Russell 2000 up 6.46% over 7 days, points to solid upside momentum. The VIX has collapsed by roughly 34% over the week to 16.35 while the 10Y yield is slightly lower over 7 days, a combination that typically supports further equity gains. Futures remain notably stronger than spot, especially in small caps, suggesting positive positioning into the next full session, though the recent CME outage and lack of a single dominant data catalyst temper confidence from being higher.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the major U.S. indices can sustain and extend their recent break higher, particularly with the S&P 500 near 6,849 and the Nasdaq Composite around 23,366 after solid 1d and 7d gains. Small caps deserve special attention: the Russell 2000 at roughly 2,500 on cash and 2,505 on futures has outperformed sharply over the last week, and whether that leadership persists will be a key tell for risk-on breadth. For an upside bias to hold, maintaining positive breadth (currently 12 up vs 3 down) and avoiding a sharp reversal in the VIX from its 16.35 level will be important. Overnight, focus should also remain on macro indicators that could affect the 10Y yield, currently about 4.02% after a 2.6% weekly decline, since a renewed back-up in yields could challenge the equity rally. Cross-asset signals in gold and crude bear monitoring: gold’s 3.1% 1d jump suggests some lingering demand for safety even as equities rally, while WTI crude’s 2.6% weekly drop may weigh on energy-related names despite the broader risk-on tone. Any fresh Fed commentary or U.S. data that either reinforce or undermine current rate-cut expectations will likely determine whether futures, which are currently 2–3.6% above prior levels depending on the index, can lead cash markets higher into the next session.
=======
  Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone, as all four major U.S. indices are up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.3–4.2% over the past month, while small caps are outperforming with the Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day and 6.46% over the week. Broad ETFs echo this strength, with SPY up 0.55% and QQQ up 0.81% today, indicating firm appetite for both broad market and growth/tech exposure.
  
  Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of risk-taking: the VIX is down 4.89% on the day and nearly 34% over the week to 16.35, signaling easing stress, while the 10Y Treasury yield is only slightly higher on the day (+0.48%) and lower over the week (-2.57%), suggesting rate concerns are not pressuring equities. This combination of rising stocks, falling volatility, and contained yields points to improving risk appetite rather than fading.
  
  Futures reinforce the bullish risk tone, with S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow contracts all up about 2.1–2.6% on the day and 1.1–1.5% over the week, and Russell futures leading with a 3.57% daily gain and 4.55% weekly rise. Concurrent gains in gold (+3.09% on the day) alongside stronger equities and a slightly weaker dollar (-0.14% on the day) suggest investors are comfortable adding both risk and hedges, but the dominant signal from price action is a strong bid for equities.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid based on the benchmark changes, with breadth showing 12 assets up versus only 3 down and the average index move around +0.62% on the day. All major equity indices are higher, led by the Nasdaq and Russell 2000, indicating broad participation rather than a narrow rally. The VIX sliding to 16.35 with a 33–35% drop over the week and month, combined with a modestly lower 10Y yield over the week, signals a calmer macro backdrop. Overall, the tape points to a healthy risk environment with improving sentiment and no acute stress in rates or volatility.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day and week, leadership is coming from growth and small caps, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.65% on the day and 4.16% over the week, and the Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day and 6.46% on the week. QQQ is a standout on the day among ETFs with a 0.81% gain. On the lagging side, energy is soft via WTI crude, which is down 0.49% on the day and 2.56% over the week, while Russell futures show the weakest 30-day profile at -0.22% despite strong short-term gains.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro sentiment is being buoyed by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and softer U.S. data, as highlighted by coverage pointing to "weaker job growth and lower inflation" lining up for a potential Fed cut in December and recent rallies tied to "Fed rate cut hopes." This backdrop is consistent with lower VIX readings and a 10Y yield that is down 2.57% over the week, which together support a risk-on environment by reducing discount-rate pressure on equities and encouraging flows into stocks and futures. Globally, trading conditions are somewhat distorted by technical and holiday factors, including a CME data-center issue that temporarily halted many futures markets and mixed, holiday-thinned trading with Wall Street closures around Thanksgiving. Despite this, U.S. index futures are sharply higher today (S&P +2.06%, Nasdaq +2.14%, Dow +2.64%), suggesting that once the technical disruptions were resolved, underlying macro optimism reasserted itself and reinforced risk-on positioning. Broader cross-asset signals also reflect a mix of macro and thematic drivers: gold futures are up 3.09% on the day and 3.20% over the week, supported by the combination of Fed-cut expectations and a slightly softer dollar, while crypto and AI-related narratives in the news point to ongoing enthusiasm for growth and innovation themes. These factors collectively tilt the tape toward risk-on behavior, even as some assets like crude oil trend lower, which may hint at lingering concerns about global growth or supply-demand balances.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% Based on broad equity gains today (major indices up roughly 0.5–0.7%, small caps and QQQ leading) and strong equity futures moves (S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures up 2–3.6%), the near-term momentum is skewed to the upside. The VIX dropping nearly 5% on the day and more than 30% over the week, alongside a slightly lower 10Y yield over the week, indicates a supportive macro and volatility backdrop rather than an imminent risk-off turn. While specific upcoming data or events are not detailed, the existing risk-on tone and positive breadth suggest the path of least resistance over the next 24 hours is upward.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should focus on whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can sustain recent strength, with the S&P 500 near 6,849 and S&P futures around 6,859.5, as a hold above these zones would confirm the current momentum. Watching QQQ, which is leading with a 0.81% daily gain, will help gauge if large-cap tech continues to anchor risk-on sentiment or begins to stall after its strong weekly run. Small caps and cyclicals deserve close attention, given the Russell 2000's 6.46% weekly gain and Russell futures' 3.57% daily jump, which signal improving risk appetite down the cap spectrum; any reversal there could be an early warning for a broader pause. On the macro side, monitoring the VIX around 16 and the 10Y yield near 4.02% will be key: continued low volatility and contained yields would align with the expected upside bias, while a sharp VIX spike or yield jump could challenge the current rally. Cross-asset, traders should also track gold and crude: gold's 3.09% daily rise to 4,218.3 may indicate persistent demand for hedges even in a risk-on tape, while WTI's decline to 58.55 and negative 1-week trend could pressure energy equities. A stabilization or rebound in crude would support broader cyclical sectors, whereas further downside in oil alongside strong indices might reinforce a growth-and-tech-led advance rather than a fully broad-based cyclicals rally.

### Latest news (0-3 days)

- no news is good news?


## 1. Pulse

<<<<<<< HEAD
Across equities, the tone is clearly risk-on with all major U.S. benchmarks up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–4.2% over the past week, while small caps in the Russell 2000 have surged 6.5% over 7 days. ETFs mirror this strength, with SPY up 0.55% and QQQ up 0.81% on the day, indicating broad participation with a growth tilt and improving risk appetite. The average 1d index gain of about 0.62% and 12 up vs 3 down in the breadth snapshot confirm a constructive tape.

Volatility and rates are reinforcing this supportive backdrop. The VIX is down 4.9% on the day and almost 34% over the week to 16.35, signaling a sharp compression in hedging demand as equity indices rally. The 10Y Treasury yield is little changed on the day at 4.02% (+0.48% 1d) but has eased 2.6% over the week, suggesting rate pressure has not been an impediment to equities and is moderately supportive of risk.

Futures pricing is even more bullish than spot, highlighting strong near-term risk appetite. S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow futures are all up roughly 2.1–2.6% on the day, and Russell futures stand out with a 3.6% 1d jump and 4.6% gain over the week, despite being flat over 30 days. This combination of strong equity and futures gains, falling volatility, and stable-to-softer yields indicates risk appetite is improving meaningfully rather than fading, with multi-asset confirmation from gold’s 3.1% 1d rise and a slightly softer dollar.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health screens as strong based on the benchmark changes. The average 1d index move is about +0.62%, and breadth shows 12 instruments up versus only 3 down, pointing to broad participation rather than a narrow mega-cap rally. Volatility has compressed sharply, with the VIX down nearly 34% over the week to 16.35, while the 10Y yield is modestly lower over 7 days, reducing rate headwinds. Taken together, the mix of positive breadth, moderate index gains, and a calmer volatility and Treasury backdrop suggests a relatively healthy risk environment.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day, leadership is coming from growth and cyclicals via QQQ (+0.81%) and the Russell 2000 (+0.58% cash, +3.57% on Russell futures), with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.65%. On a weekly basis, small caps are clear standouts, with the Russell 2000 up 6.46% versus 3.5–4.2% for the large-cap indices. On the downside, the main laggards are in commodities: WTI crude is off 0.49% on the day and down 2.56% over the week, while the U.S. dollar is slightly weaker on the day (-0.14%) and week (-0.09%), underscoring that leadership is centered in equities rather than in defensives or energy.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and trading-structure factors around the U.S. holiday period are influencing today’s tape. U.S. markets operated on an early Black Friday close, and a CME Group outage tied to a data centre cooling failure temporarily halted futures trading, which can distort intraday liquidity and price discovery. Despite that disruption, the end-state was constructive, with U.S. stock futures and cash indices closing solidly in the green, indicating that the outage was a transient operational issue rather than a risk-off macro shock. Rate expectations and associated policy narratives are also in the backdrop, supporting a risk-on tone. Recent coverage notes that Fed commentary and weak data have boosted global rate-cut hopes, and the U.S. 10Y yield has drifted about 2.6% lower over the week even as equities climbed 3.5–4.2%, which is a classic risk-supportive combination. The concurrent drop in the VIX by roughly a third over the week suggests investors are growing more comfortable with the macro path, treating softer yields and dovish-leaning signals as catalysts for adding equity and growth exposure. Sector and cross-asset flows hint at a blend of risk-on positioning and some hedging via hard assets. Pre-market commentary highlighted strong gains in U.S. futures and specific growth names, while gold futures jumped 3.1% on the day and over 3.2% on the week, pointing to persistent demand for protection against macro or geopolitical uncertainty. At the same time, WTI crude’s 2.6% weekly decline and the mildly weaker dollar indicate that energy and FX are not the primary drivers of current equity strength, leaving monetary policy expectations and year-end positioning as the dominant tape themes in risk terms.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** The next 24 hours are likely to be driven by the full reopening of U.S. markets after the Black Friday early close, plus any scheduled U.S. economic data and Fed-related commentary referenced in pre-market coverage, such as employment or inflation prints and policy speeches; these can shift rate-cut expectations and thus equity risk appetite. In addition, any follow-up communication from CME Group or exchanges regarding the recent futures outage could influence confidence in futures liquidity, though the impact so far has been limited. Earnings-specific catalysts are not highlighted in the provided data, so macro releases and policy rhetoric remain the key near-term triggers.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% confidence. Broad-based equity strength over the last day and week, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.5–4.2% on the week and the Russell 2000 up 6.46% over 7 days, points to solid upside momentum. The VIX has collapsed by roughly 34% over the week to 16.35 while the 10Y yield is slightly lower over 7 days, a combination that typically supports further equity gains. Futures remain notably stronger than spot, especially in small caps, suggesting positive positioning into the next full session, though the recent CME outage and lack of a single dominant data catalyst temper confidence from being higher.

3.2. **Watch List:** Traders should watch whether the major U.S. indices can sustain and extend their recent break higher, particularly with the S&P 500 near 6,849 and the Nasdaq Composite around 23,366 after solid 1d and 7d gains. Small caps deserve special attention: the Russell 2000 at roughly 2,500 on cash and 2,505 on futures has outperformed sharply over the last week, and whether that leadership persists will be a key tell for risk-on breadth. For an upside bias to hold, maintaining positive breadth (currently 12 up vs 3 down) and avoiding a sharp reversal in the VIX from its 16.35 level will be important. Overnight, focus should also remain on macro indicators that could affect the 10Y yield, currently about 4.02% after a 2.6% weekly decline, since a renewed back-up in yields could challenge the equity rally. Cross-asset signals in gold and crude bear monitoring: gold’s 3.1% 1d jump suggests some lingering demand for safety even as equities rally, while WTI crude’s 2.6% weekly drop may weigh on energy-related names despite the broader risk-on tone. Any fresh Fed commentary or U.S. data that either reinforce or undermine current rate-cut expectations will likely determine whether futures, which are currently 2–3.6% above prior levels depending on the index, can lead cash markets higher into the next session.
=======
Equities are trading with a clear risk-on tone, as all four major U.S. indices are up around 0.5–0.7% on the day and 3.3–4.2% over the past month, while small caps are outperforming with the Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day and 6.46% over the week. Broad ETFs echo this strength, with SPY up 0.55% and QQQ up 0.81% today, indicating firm appetite for both broad market and growth/tech exposure.

Volatility and rates are broadly supportive of risk-taking: the VIX is down 4.89% on the day and nearly 34% over the week to 16.35, signaling easing stress, while the 10Y Treasury yield is only slightly higher on the day (+0.48%) and lower over the week (-2.57%), suggesting rate concerns are not pressuring equities. This combination of rising stocks, falling volatility, and contained yields points to improving risk appetite rather than fading.

Futures reinforce the bullish risk tone, with S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow contracts all up about 2.1–2.6% on the day and 1.1–1.5% over the week, and Russell futures leading with a 3.57% daily gain and 4.55% weekly rise. Concurrent gains in gold (+3.09% on the day) alongside stronger equities and a slightly weaker dollar (-0.14% on the day) suggest investors are comfortable adding both risk and hedges, but the dominant signal from price action is a strong bid for equities.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solid based on the benchmark changes, with breadth showing 12 assets up versus only 3 down and the average index move around +0.62% on the day. All major equity indices are higher, led by the Nasdaq and Russell 2000, indicating broad participation rather than a narrow rally. The VIX sliding to 16.35 with a 33–35% drop over the week and month, combined with a modestly lower 10Y yield over the week, signals a calmer macro backdrop. Overall, the tape points to a healthy risk environment with improving sentiment and no acute stress in rates or volatility.

1.2. **Leadership:** Over the last day and week, leadership is coming from growth and small caps, with the Nasdaq Composite up 0.65% on the day and 4.16% over the week, and the Russell 2000 up 0.58% on the day and 6.46% on the week. QQQ is a standout on the day among ETFs with a 0.81% gain. On the lagging side, energy is soft via WTI crude, which is down 0.49% on the day and 2.56% over the week, while Russell futures show the weakest 30-day profile at -0.22% despite strong short-term gains.

## 2. Drivers

2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro sentiment is being buoyed by expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and softer U.S. data, as highlighted by coverage pointing to "weaker job growth and lower inflation" lining up for a potential Fed cut in December and recent rallies tied to "Fed rate cut hopes." This backdrop is consistent with lower VIX readings and a 10Y yield that is down 2.57% over the week, which together support a risk-on environment by reducing discount-rate pressure on equities and encouraging flows into stocks and futures. Globally, trading conditions are somewhat distorted by technical and holiday factors, including a CME data-center issue that temporarily halted many futures markets and mixed, holiday-thinned trading with Wall Street closures around Thanksgiving. Despite this, U.S. index futures are sharply higher today (S&P +2.06%, Nasdaq +2.14%, Dow +2.64%), suggesting that once the technical disruptions were resolved, underlying macro optimism reasserted itself and reinforced risk-on positioning. Broader cross-asset signals also reflect a mix of macro and thematic drivers: gold futures are up 3.09% on the day and 3.20% over the week, supported by the combination of Fed-cut expectations and a slightly softer dollar, while crypto and AI-related narratives in the news point to ongoing enthusiasm for growth and innovation themes. These factors collectively tilt the tape toward risk-on behavior, even as some assets like crude oil trend lower, which may hint at lingering concerns about global growth or supply-demand balances.

2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% Based on broad equity gains today (major indices up roughly 0.5–0.7%, small caps and QQQ leading) and strong equity futures moves (S&P, Nasdaq, Dow, and Russell futures up 2–3.6%), the near-term momentum is skewed to the upside. The VIX dropping nearly 5% on the day and more than 30% over the week, alongside a slightly lower 10Y yield over the week, indicates a supportive macro and volatility backdrop rather than an imminent risk-off turn. While specific upcoming data or events are not detailed, the existing risk-on tone and positive breadth suggest the path of least resistance over the next 24 hours is upward.

3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should focus on whether the S&P 500 and Nasdaq can sustain recent strength, with the S&P 500 near 6,849 and S&P futures around 6,859.5, as a hold above these zones would confirm the current momentum. Watching QQQ, which is leading with a 0.81% daily gain, will help gauge if large-cap tech continues to anchor risk-on sentiment or begins to stall after its strong weekly run. Small caps and cyclicals deserve close attention, given the Russell 2000's 6.46% weekly gain and Russell futures' 3.57% daily jump, which signal improving risk appetite down the cap spectrum; any reversal there could be an early warning for a broader pause. On the macro side, monitoring the VIX around 16 and the 10Y yield near 4.02% will be key: continued low volatility and contained yields would align with the expected upside bias, while a sharp VIX spike or yield jump could challenge the current rally. Cross-asset, traders should also track gold and crude: gold's 3.09% daily rise to 4,218.3 may indicate persistent demand for hedges even in a risk-on tape, while WTI's decline to 58.55 and negative 1-week trend could pressure energy equities. A stabilization or rebound in crude would support broader cyclical sectors, whereas further downside in oil alongside strong indices might reinforce a growth-and-tech-led advance rather than a fully broad-based cyclicals rally.
