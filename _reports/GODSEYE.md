  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-12T05:22:38.751064+00:00">2025-11-12 05:22 UTC</time> (runtime 39.17s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities showed a mild risk-on tilt with rotation: the Dow 30 led at +1.18% while the S&P 500 edged up +0.21%; the Nasdaq Composite lagged at -0.25% and the Russell 2000 was slightly positive at +0.11%. Breadth leaned constructive (10 up, 5 down) and the average 1-day index change was +0.20%, indicating incremental improvement in risk appetite despite growth underperformance.
  
  Volatility eased as the VIX fell -1.82% to 17.28, though it remains up +6.14% over 30 days, suggesting only a cautious fade in risk aversion. Rates firmed slightly with the 10Y Treasury yield up +0.24% to 4.12%, a modest headwind for duration-sensitive tech that aligns with Nasdaq’s underperformance.
  
  Futures point to a slightly firmer tone into the next session: S&P futures +0.18%, Nasdaq futures +0.35%, Dow futures +0.09%, while Russell futures slipped -0.14%. On balance, risk appetite is improving modestly, quantified by lower front-end volatility and positive index futures, but remains uneven across style and size.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health is moderately positive. Breadth was supportive (10 advancers vs 5 decliners) and the average 1-day index gain of +0.20% reflects a gentle bid rather than a surge. The VIX fell -1.82% to 17.28, indicating easing stress, while the 10Y yield ticked up to 4.12% (+0.24%), tempering enthusiasm for growth. Netting these, conditions are constructive but not exuberant.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership rotated to cyclicals and defensives: the Dow 30 was the standout at +1.18% on the day, while the Nasdaq Composite lagged at -0.25% (QQQ -0.27%). Over the past week, Dow futures led at +1.26% and Nasdaq futures trailed at -1.43%, with the Russell 2000 also soft on a 7-day basis at -0.85%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Progress toward ending the U.S. government shutdown has underpinned risk sentiment, with headlines noting that impediments to reopening are easing and pre-market tone improved on those hopes. This catalyst skews risk-on by reducing policy uncertainty, reflected in lower VIX (-1.82% 1d) and firmer S&P futures (+0.18%). Commodity and FX moves frame the macro backdrop: WTI crude slipped (-0.39% 1d), which can ease inflation pressures and support equities at the margin, while gold continued to climb (+0.17% 1d, +6.37% 30d) alongside a slightly firmer dollar (+0.13% 1d). The mix implies a cautious risk-on tone with some hedging still present, consistent with Dow leadership and tech underperformance amid a small uptick in yields. Overnight commentary highlighted a revived AI trade alongside shutdown optimism, aligning with Nasdaq futures strength (+0.35%) even as the Nasdaq cash index fell -0.25% in the prior session. If futures-led tech stabilization persists, it would support a broader risk-on re-engagement; if not, rotation toward cyclicals may continue.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% driven by modestly positive index futures (ES +0.18%, NQ +0.35%), supportive breadth (10 up, 5 down), and a lower VIX (-1.82%) on headlines that a government funding resolution is progressing; confidence is tempered by Nasdaq cash underperformance and a small rise in the 10Y yield to 4.12%.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether Nasdaq futures (+0.35% to 25,730.75) can hold gains into the cash open; sustained strength would help narrow the gap with the prior day’s Nasdaq Composite decline (-0.25%). Track S&P futures around the 6,883–6,900 area and Russell futures near 2,462.7; continued Russell softness (-0.14% 1d) would signal rotation persists rather than broadening risk-on. Monitor macro gauges: the VIX at 17.28 (a drift lower would validate risk-on) and the 10Y Treasury yield at 4.12% (+0.24% 1d), as further rate firmness could cap tech. In commodities and FX, WTI at 60.80 and the U.S. Dollar at 99.59 set the inflation and earnings translation backdrop, while elevated gold (4,113.80) signals residual hedging that could limit upside if haven demand intensifies.
