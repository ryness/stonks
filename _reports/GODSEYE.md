  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities staged a broad rebound with the S&P 500 up 0.98%, Dow 1.08%, Nasdaq 0.88%, and Russell 2000 outperforming at 2.80%, while SPY rose 1.00% and QQQ 0.75%; breadth was constructive (12 up vs 3 down) and the average index change was +1.25%, signaling an improvement in risk appetite on the day.
  
  Volatility eased as VIX fell 11.32% to 23.43, but its 7-day surge of 33.81% keeps the backdrop cautious; rates helped the tone with the 10Y Treasury yield down 1.05% on the day to 4.06, providing a tailwind to equities.
  
  Futures echoed the risk-on bounce (ES +0.96%, YM +1.08%, NQ +0.72%, RTY +2.80%), yet the weekly picture remains risk-off with 7-day declines of 3.7%–5.1% across major contracts; net, risk appetite is improving tactically but remains fragile given recent drawdowns.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks tentatively constructive: 12 advancers vs 3 decliners and a +1.25% average index gain point to a solid breadth-driven bounce. The VIX’s 11.32% drop to 23.43 helps, but its 33.81% jump over the past week keeps volatility elevated. A 1.05% decline in the 10Y yield to 4.06 supports equities near term. Overall, the tape is healthier than earlier in the week but not fully out of the woods.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership favored small caps with the Russell 2000 up 2.80% on the day, while tech lagged on a weekly basis as the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.84% over 7 days. A positive standout was the Dow 30 at +1.08% 1d, while a negative standout was WTI Crude at -1.83% 1d. The divergence underscores a cyclical/small-cap bid amid ongoing pressure on growth proxies week over week.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Fed-related commentary boosted confidence in potential rate cuts, supporting a risk-on tone; this aligns with the 10Y yield slipping 1.05% to 4.06 and broad equity gains (S&P 500 +0.98%, Dow +1.08%), as highlighted by reports of a late-week bounce tied to policy optimism. Countering that, concerns over AI-driven exuberance and bubble talk weighed on sentiment through the week, with coverage noting AI valuation worries and a turbulent stretch that left major averages lower over 7 days and VIX up 33.81%—a risk-off overhang despite today’s relief.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% — The broad 1-day rebound (avg index +1.25%, RUT +2.80%) and VIX decline (-11.32%) are offset by elevated volatility (VIX 23.43, +33.81% 7d) and sizable weekly losses across equities, with no specific near-term catalysts identified to extend the move.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch whether S&P futures hold above their prior reference of 6,557.50 after closing 6,620.25; a stable VIX near 23.43 and avoidance of a push back toward the prior 26.42 reference would support a range-bound session consistent with a flat bias. Monitor leadership: small caps led (RTY futures +2.80% 1d to 2,375.30) while Nasdaq remains the weekly laggard (NQ futures -5.14% 7d, last 24,305.50 vs 24,131.50 prior reference). If tech steadies around these marks and QQQ (590.07) holds, chop is more likely than trend. Keep an eye on macro levers: the 10Y yield at 4.06 (−1.05% 1d) and the US Dollar at 100.20 (+0.72% 7d) for any risk headwinds, and energy given WTI at 58.06 (−1.83% 1d) which could weigh on energy equities while gold’s 4,079.50 (+0.57% 1d) hints at lingering hedging demand.
