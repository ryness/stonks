  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities and futures show a tentative risk-on tilt today: S&P 500 +0.97%, Dow +0.32%, Russell 2000 +0.75%, with QQQ +1.51% and S&P/Nasdaq futures up +0.91%/+1.41%, respectively. However, the 7-day tape remains weaker across majors (e.g., S&P -2.21%, Dow -2.39%, Russell futures -3.58%), signaling that the rebound is counter-trend.
  
  Volatility eased but remains elevated, with VIX down 10.13% on the day to 22.19 yet still up 26% over 7 days and 36% over 30 days. Rates are largely steady as the 10Y sits at 4.13% (+0.10% d/d), which, alongside breadth skewed positive (11 up, 4 down) and an average index change of +0.25% today, points to improving near-term risk appetite that is still fragile in the broader context.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market Health: Breadth is constructive at 11 up vs 4 down with an average index change of +0.25% on the day, indicating a modest rebound. The VIX fell 10% to 22.19 but remains elevated on a 7-day and 30-day basis, so underlying stress persists. The 10Y Treasury yield is steady near 4.13% (+0.10% d/d), suggesting rates are not adding fresh pressure. Overall, conditions look cautiously improving today within a still fragile weekly downtrend.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership: On the day, QQQ led with +1.51% alongside the S&P 500 at +0.97% and Russell 2000 at +0.75%, while WTI Crude lagged at -2.93% and the Nasdaq Composite fell -1.21%. Over the past week, small caps and growth have underperformed with Russell futures -3.58% and Nasdaq futures -3.01%, while defensives like Gold futures were marginally positive at +0.33%.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** AI sentiment is a key macro driver, with headlines citing growing fears of an AI bubble and related tech weakness; this has fed into broader equity volatility. That said, today’s tech-led bounce (QQQ +1.51%, Nasdaq futures +1.41%) suggests episodic relief rallies when fears ebb, making AI narratives a swing factor for risk-on/off moves. Hawkish Federal Reserve commentary in recent coverage has dampened rate-cut expectations, contributing to recent equity weakness and higher volatility. With the 10Y little changed at 4.13% and the VIX still elevated despite a 10% daily drop, the policy narrative is keeping a risk premium embedded even as day-to-day tone improves. Caution around upcoming data and earnings has been flagged, including jobs data and a widely watched Nvidia print, while risk proxies like Bitcoin have shown weakness in recent headlines. Combined with today’s commodity signals (WTI -2.93% and Gold +1.57%), the tape reflects a blend of growth concerns and hedging demand that can toggle risk appetite quickly.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Nvidia earnings within the next 24 hours could swing tech leadership and broader risk sentiment, particularly for Nasdaq futures and QQQ. U.S. jobs data referenced in headlines is another near-term catalyst that can shift rate expectations, volatility, and the equity tone.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 55% — Futures are green (ES +0.91%, NQ +1.41%, RTY +0.87%), breadth is positive (11 up, 4 down), and the VIX eased 10% to 22.19 while the 10Y stayed near 4.13%, supporting a modest rebound; confidence is tempered by the still-elevated VIX and 7-day equity declines.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech leadership into and after Nvidia’s report: NQ 24,941 and QQQ 605 as markers for follow-through, and ES near 6,700 as a risk-on barometer. A sustained bid in these levels would validate the intraday improvement signaled by today’s futures and cash gains. Monitor VIX near 22; a decisive move lower would reinforce the rebound, while a re-acceleration higher would warn the rally is fragile. Keep an eye on the 10Y yield around 4.13% and the US Dollar at 99.95; a simultaneous rise in both could cap equities. Track breadth via small caps: Russell 2000 at 2,366 and RTY futures at 2,376 should participate to broaden the advance. Also watch commodities for macro cues: further WTI weakness from 58.96 could flag growth concerns, while persistent strength in Gold at 4,125.20 would underline defensive positioning.
