  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-24T20:25:26.596271+00:00">2025-11-24 20:25 UTC</time> (runtime 1m 10s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Risk appetite improved notably today across equities, with the S&P 500 up 1.54%, Nasdaq Composite up 2.65%, and Russell 2000 up 1.71% while the Dow lagged at +0.45%. Breadth was strong at 12 up vs 3 down and the average index change was 1.66%, signaling broad participation behind the rebound.
  
  Futures confirmed the tone: S&P futures rose 1.55%, Nasdaq futures 2.63%, Russell futures 1.79%, and Dow futures 0.52%. That said, the 7-day picture remains mixed to soft (ES -0.55%, NQ -0.60%, YM -2.07%, RTY +1.16%), indicating today’s risk-on bid is a rebound within a choppy week.
  
  Volatility eased as the VIX fell 11.82% to 20.66, though it remains higher than a month ago (+8.57% over 30d), tempering exuberance. Rates were supportive with the 10Y Treasury yield down 0.62% on the day and 1.80% on the week to 4.04, while the US Dollar was essentially flat on the day (-0.02%), a generally accommodating backdrop for equities.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health improved on the day with breadth at 12 up and 3 down and an average index gain of 1.66%, pointing to a broad-based advance. Volatility cooled as the VIX dropped 11.82% to 20.66, but it remains higher versus 30 days ago (+8.57%), keeping caution in the medium-term backdrop. The 10Y Treasury yield easing to 4.04% (-0.62% 1d, -1.80% 7d) supports risk assets. Net-net, conditions look healthier short term, though the recent weekly softness in major benchmarks argues for measured optimism.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership skewed to growth/tech with the Nasdaq Composite up 2.65% and QQQ up 2.61% on the day, while small caps also outperformed (Russell 2000 +1.71%). The Dow was the day’s laggard at +0.45%, and volatility was a negative standout with VIX -11.82%. Over the week, the Russell futures lead (+1.16%) while the Dow futures lag (-2.07%), with the S&P 500 (-0.49%) and Nasdaq Composite (-0.03%) trailing to flat.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Easing rate expectations aided risk sentiment as a recent Fed official’s comments boosted confidence in the likelihood of a cut, and gold commentary highlighted market focus on the Fed’s next move. This aligns with lower 10Y yields (-0.62% 1d, -1.80% 7d) and a broad equity rebound, a risk-on catalyst. Tech sentiment remains a key swing factor after a turbulent week around AI leadership narratives, with reports noting rallies that faded and a sharp weekly drawdown. Today’s strong Nasdaq performance (+2.65%) suggests a rebound in that theme, but with the VIX still higher than a month ago (+8.57%), the overall setup retains a risk-off undercurrent if tech momentum stumbles again. Fixed income context points to a ‘data vacuum’ in the near term, with bonds upbeat but yields range-bound, per the bond market update. In practice, that can leave markets more sensitive to incremental headlines while the easing yield backdrop tilts the tape modestly risk-on.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** unknown
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% — Today’s broad equity gains (S&P +1.54%, Nasdaq +2.65%, Russell +1.71%), a sharp VIX drop (-11.82% to 20.66), supportive rates (10Y -0.62% to 4.04), and risk-on futures (ES +1.55%, NQ +2.63%) suggest positive follow-through over the next 24 hours, though mixed 7-day performance tempers confidence.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech leadership for confirmation: Nasdaq futures near 24,944 and the 25,000 area as a psychological pivot, with QQQ momentum after a 2.61% day. For the S&P 500, monitor the 6,700 handle (cash last 6,704.57; ES last 6,723) for sustained holds; sustained strength there would support an ‘up’ bias. Monitor volatility and rates for validation: VIX at 20.66—further drift below 21 would underpin risk, while a quick snap back would challenge the rally. The 10Y Treasury at 4.04% is supportive; holding near or below current levels would reinforce equity multiple support. Check breadth and cyclicals: Small caps (RTY futures last 2,417.70; cash RUT 2,410.17) need follow-through above the 2,420 area to confirm broader risk appetite. Energy sensitivity could pick up with WTI at $58.93 (+1.50% 1d); continued firmness would aid energy equities, while a reversal would weaken cyclicals.
