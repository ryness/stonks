  ### Latest news (0-3 days)
  
  - no news is good news?
  
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Across major US equities, the tone is modestly risk-on but rotational. The S&P 500 and Dow gained 0.19% and 0.66% on the day, while the Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.06% jump, yet the Nasdaq Composite was slightly negative at -0.03%. On a 7-day view, however, most indices are down (S&P -0.29%, Nasdaq -0.82%, Russell -1.98%), indicating that today's uptick is more of a bounce within a mild pullback than a strong new uptrend.
  
  Volatility and futures pricing suggest improving near-term risk appetite despite that recent consolidation. The VIX fell 2.94% on the day to 14.51 and is down 41% over 30 days, pointing to a significant easing in equity risk premia, while S&P futures rose 0.12%, Dow futures 0.54%, and Russell futures 0.95%; only Nasdaq futures lagged at -0.24%. In rates, the 10Y Treasury yield is up only 0.58% on the day and about 1.6% over 30 days to 4.19%, a small move that, alongside strong 1-month equity gains (S&P +3.64%, Dow +4.97%, Russell +6.79%), is consistent with a constructive but selective risk-on environment rather than a broad de-risking.
  
  Cross-asset moves show a mixed but generally supportive backdrop for risk. Gold is higher on the day (+0.38%) and up strongly over 30 days (+6.91%), while crude is soft both daily (-0.16%) and over the month (-5.61%), and the US dollar is little changed day-to-day (+0.16%) but slightly weaker over a month (-1.12%). Taken together with 10 advancers versus 5 decliners across the monitored assets and an average 1-day index gain of about 0.31%, this points to risk appetite improving on the day but still digesting prior gains, with investors favoring cyclicals and small caps over mega-cap tech in the very near term.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is supportive with 10 instruments up versus 5 down and an average 1-day index gain of roughly 0.31%, led by the Dow (+0.66%) and Russell 2000 (+1.06%). The VIX near 14.5 and down almost 3% on the day, together with only a small uptick in the 10Y yield to 4.19%, suggests contained stress in both volatility and rates. Overall, the tape appears healthy but not euphoric, with short-term consolidation over the last week following strong 30-day advances across most equity benchmarks.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is clearly in cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.06% and Dow 30 up 0.66%, while the S&P 500 added a more modest 0.19%. On the downside, growth and tech-related benchmarks lagged, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.03% and QQQ off 0.19% on the day. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 (-1.98%) and Nasdaq (-0.82% for the Composite, -0.98% for QQQ) are notable laggards, whereas the Dow is roughly flat over 7 days (+0.04%), reinforcing a slight tilt toward more defensive, value-oriented large caps rather than high-beta tech.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Macro and geopolitical themes are broadly supportive but somewhat lacking fresh catalysts. Coverage notes that global stocks have started 2026 positively, with advances in US equity futures and precious metals driven by earnings expectations and ongoing AI optimism, framing a generally risk-on backdrop after strong 2025 gains. At the same time, Indian markets are described as range-bound with thin volumes and continued foreign selling, highlighting that local flows and valuation concerns can dampen enthusiasm even when the global macro tone is constructive. Central-bank and policy expectations remain a key macro driver in the background. News flow flags that investors are watching upcoming Federal Reserve actions and FOMC minutes, with recent commentary emphasizing that strong 2025 returns were powered by AI and earnings despite episodic volatility tied to rising bond yields. This keeps markets in a conditional risk-on stance: supportive growth narratives and liquidity expectations are encouraging equity exposure, but the modest grind higher in the 10Y yield to 4.19% and the recent 7-day uptick in VIX (+3.05%) underscore that any hawkish surprise could quickly shift the tape to risk-off. Regionally, there is some divergence that tempers global risk appetite. Australian futures are expected to open slightly lower amid holiday-thinned volumes, and Indian markets have been flat-to-range-bound into the new year, with local factors like Q3 earnings and budget expectations driving stock-specific rather than broad index moves. This mosaic of strong developed-market performance, cautious Asia-Pacific sentiment, and idiosyncratic emerging-market drivers points to a risk-on bias globally, but one that is more selective and catalyst-dependent than a synchronized rally.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Concrete near-term triggers highlighted in the news include the upcoming release of Federal Reserve FOMC meeting minutes, which could shift rate expectations and thereby move both yields and equity indices. In India, the start of the Q3 earnings season and evolving budget expectations are flagged as key drivers for local equity sentiment over the next sessions. Globally, traders are also watching developments around the India-US trade deal and broader Fed policy guidance referenced in pre-market commentary, which can influence risk-on versus risk-off positioning across equities, FX, and commodities over the next 24 hours.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence – The modestly positive 1-day moves in the S&P 500 (+0.19%), Dow (+0.66%), and Russell 2000 (+1.06%), alongside gains in corresponding futures (S&P +0.12%, Dow +0.54%, Russell +0.94%), suggest underlying buying interest following a shallow 7-day pullback. A 2.94% drop in the VIX to 14.51 and only a small rise in the 10Y yield indicate limited near-term stress, while macro news points to supportive narratives around earnings and AI-driven growth. With no clearly negative, time-specific catalysts flagged in the next 24 hours, the balance of evidence favors a slight upward bias rather than a renewed downturn or flat trade.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether small caps can extend their recent outperformance, focusing on the Russell 2000 near 2,500 and Russell futures around 2,520 as reference zones that have been associated with a 7.04% 30-day gain. Sustained strength there, together with continued resilience in the Dow around the 48,000–48,500 area and S&P levels near 6,850–6,900 (futures at 6,900.5), would confirm that the current bounce is broadening beyond mega-cap leadership. Monitoring QQQ and Nasdaq futures, which lagged today, will be important to see if tech catches up or continues to be a funding source for rotation. On the macro side, attention should stay on the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.19 and the VIX near the mid-teens, as a sharp move higher in either could quickly challenge the constructive bias. Traders should also track market reaction around the release of FOMC meeting minutes and any earnings or guidance updates flagged in pre-market commentary, particularly for sectors tied to AI and cyclicals, since these themes have underpinned the strong 30-day gains in US indices. If yields remain contained and VIX holds below recent highs while these catalysts are digested benignly, the probability of the up-bias playing out into the next session increases.

## 1. Pulse

Across major US equities, the tone is modestly risk-on but rotational. The S&P 500 and Dow gained 0.19% and 0.66% on the day, while the Russell 2000 outperformed with a 1.06% jump, yet the Nasdaq Composite was slightly negative at -0.03%. On a 7-day view, however, most indices are down (S&P -0.29%, Nasdaq -0.82%, Russell -1.98%), indicating that today's uptick is more of a bounce within a mild pullback than a strong new uptrend.

Volatility and futures pricing suggest improving near-term risk appetite despite that recent consolidation. The VIX fell 2.94% on the day to 14.51 and is down 41% over 30 days, pointing to a significant easing in equity risk premia, while S&P futures rose 0.12%, Dow futures 0.54%, and Russell futures 0.95%; only Nasdaq futures lagged at -0.24%. In rates, the 10Y Treasury yield is up only 0.58% on the day and about 1.6% over 30 days to 4.19%, a small move that, alongside strong 1-month equity gains (S&P +3.64%, Dow +4.97%, Russell +6.79%), is consistent with a constructive but selective risk-on environment rather than a broad de-risking.

Cross-asset moves show a mixed but generally supportive backdrop for risk. Gold is higher on the day (+0.38%) and up strongly over 30 days (+6.91%), while crude is soft both daily (-0.16%) and over the month (-5.61%), and the US dollar is little changed day-to-day (+0.16%) but slightly weaker over a month (-1.12%). Taken together with 10 advancers versus 5 decliners across the monitored assets and an average 1-day index gain of about 0.31%, this points to risk appetite improving on the day but still digesting prior gains, with investors favoring cyclicals and small caps over mega-cap tech in the very near term.

1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks moderately positive based on the benchmark changes. Breadth is supportive with 10 instruments up versus 5 down and an average 1-day index gain of roughly 0.31%, led by the Dow (+0.66%) and Russell 2000 (+1.06%). The VIX near 14.5 and down almost 3% on the day, together with only a small uptick in the 10Y yield to 4.19%, suggests contained stress in both volatility and rates. Overall, the tape appears healthy but not euphoric, with short-term consolidation over the last week following strong 30-day advances across most equity benchmarks.

1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership today is clearly in cyclicals and small caps, with the Russell 2000 up 1.06% and Dow 30 up 0.66%, while the S&P 500 added a more modest 0.19%. On the downside, growth and tech-related benchmarks lagged, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.03% and QQQ off 0.19% on the day. Over the last week, the Russell 2000 (-1.98%) and Nasdaq (-0.82% for the Composite, -0.98% for QQQ) are notable laggards, whereas the Dow is roughly flat over 7 days (+0.04%), reinforcing a slight tilt toward more defensive, value-oriented large caps rather than high-beta tech.

This keeps markets in a conditional risk-on stance: supportive growth narratives and liquidity expectations are encouraging equity exposure, but the modest grind higher in the 10Y yield to 4.19% and the recent 7-day uptick in VIX (+3.05%) underscore that any hawkish surprise could quickly shift the tape to risk-off.

## 3. Next 24h

3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 60% confidence – The modestly positive 1-day moves in the S&P 500 (+0.19%), Dow (+0.66%), and Russell 2000 (+1.06%), alongside gains in corresponding futures (S&P +0.12%, Dow +0.54%, Russell +0.94%), suggest underlying buying interest following a shallow 7-day pullback. A 2.94% drop in the VIX to 14.51 and only a small rise in the 10Y yield indicate limited near-term stress, while macro news points to supportive narratives around earnings and AI-driven growth. With no clearly negative, time-specific catalysts flagged in the next 24 hours, the balance of evidence favors a slight upward bias rather than a renewed downturn or flat trade.

3.2. **Watch List:** Into the next session, traders should watch whether small caps can extend their recent outperformance, focusing on the Russell 2000 near 2,500 and Russell futures around 2,520 as reference zones that have been associated with a 7.04% 30-day gain. Sustained strength there, together with continued resilience in the Dow around the 48,000–48,500 area and S&P levels near 6,850–6,900 (futures at 6,900.5), would confirm that the current bounce is broadening beyond mega-cap leadership. Monitoring QQQ and Nasdaq futures, which lagged today, will be important to see if tech catches up or continues to be a funding source for rotation. On the macro side, attention should stay on the 10Y Treasury yield around 4.19 and the VIX near the mid-teens, as a sharp move higher in either could quickly challenge the constructive bias. Traders should also track market reaction around the release of FOMC meeting minutes and any earnings or guidance updates flagged in pre-market commentary, particularly for sectors tied to AI and cyclicals, since these themes have underpinned the strong 30-day gains in US indices. If yields remain contained and VIX holds below recent highs while these catalysts are digested benignly, the probability of the up-bias playing out into the next session increases.
