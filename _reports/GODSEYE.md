  ### Latest news (0-3 days)

  ## 1. Pulse
  
  ["Equities are in a broadly risk-on mood, with all four major US indices higher on the day: S&P 500 +0.88%, Dow +0.38%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, and Russell 2000 +0.86%. Tech is leading via the Nasdaq and QQQ (+1.30%), while small caps also participate, and breadth is strong with 14 benchmarks up versus 1 down. Despite this, the 7-day tape is slightly softer for growth indices (Nasdaq -1.46%, Russell -1.18%), suggesting today's rebound follows a modest pullback rather than a new surge. ","Volatility is sharply lower, reinforcing the risk-on tone: VIX is down 11.6% on the day and 23.5% over 30 days to 14.9, indicating reduced demand for protection even as equities grind higher. Index futures echo the improved sentiment with front-month S&P futures +1.61%, Nasdaq futures +2.18%, Dow futures +0.99%, and Russell futures +1.43% on the day, all positive over 30 days. This combination of rising equity prices, stronger futures, and falling volatility points to an improving risk appetite in the near term. ","Rates and cross-asset signals are mildly mixed but not hostile to risk: the 10Y Treasury yield is up 0.85% on the day to 4.15% yet down 0.31% over the week, implying only modest rate pressure. Gold is strong (1d +1.10%, 30d +10.24%), hinting at some lingering macro hedging, while the dollar is only slightly firmer on the day (+0.29%) and lower over 30 days (-1.01%). On balance, risk appetite is improving day-on-day, with the average index up about 0.94% and volatility compressing, even if the weekly picture remains more cautious for growth sectors."]
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market health looks solidly positive on the day, with 14 of 15 tracked benchmarks higher and an average 1-day index gain of about 0.94%. Breadth across large caps, tech, and small caps is constructive, though the S&P 500 and Nasdaq remain slightly negative over the past week, pointing to a rebound rather than a runaway uptrend. Volatility is subdued, with VIX at 14.9 after an 11.6% daily drop and a 23.5% decline over 30 days, which supports a stable risk environment. The 10Y Treasury yield at 4.15% is only modestly higher on the day and roughly flat over the week, suggesting rates are not currently undermining equity strength.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership over the last day is clearly in growth and tech: the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.31% and QQQ is up 1.30%, while Nasdaq futures gain 2.18%, making them standout outperformers. On the downside, there are no major benchmarks down on the day, but over the last week small caps and tech have lagged, with the Russell 2000 -1.18% and QQQ -1.68% versus a flat-to-slightly-positive Dow (+0.16%). The Dow has been the relative leader over the past week and month (30d +2.61%), while the Nasdaq and S&P show more muted 7-day performance despite today's bounce.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** ["Macro and geopolitical narratives are centered on central bank policy and global rate dynamics. A key theme is the Bank of Japan's interest-rate hike, which pushed global bond yields higher and briefly lifted Japan's 10-year yield to its highest level since 2006, according to multiple reports. Despite higher yields, US and Asian equities traded firmer, which the articles frame as traders viewing the move as manageable, leaning risk-on rather than triggering a risk-off shock. ","Another important driver is the renewed strength in US and global tech, highlighted by coverage that "stocks rally as strength in tech boosts market sentiment" and references to a tech-led bounce on Wall Street that lifted Asian markets. This tech recovery is underpinning the outperformance of the Nasdaq and QQQ and is being interpreted as a supportive, risk-on catalyst after a choppy period that included concerns over an AI-driven bubble. ","Broader narratives around policy expectations and cross-asset flows also shape the tape: reports reference markets "gearing up for the year-end stretch" that typically favors equities and note that S&P futures gained on Fed rate-cut hopes. Concurrently, pieces discussing range-bound crypto post-FOMC and commentary on elevated but contained bond yields suggest investors are recalibrating to a higher-for-longer, but not worsening, rate environment—generally consistent with a cautiously constructive risk tone."]
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Over the next 24 hours, the main identifiable market-moving events from the provided data are company earnings reports, specifically Darden Restaurants' Q2 2026 earnings and FedEx's Q2 earnings, which analysts expect to be roughly in line with prior results; these could affect consumer and transport/logistics sentiment and, by extension, broader cyclicals depending on guidance. In addition, ongoing market digestion of the recent Bank of Japan rate hike and its impact on global yields may continue to influence risk assets, particularly if bond yields move sharply. No major US macro data or central bank decisions beyond this BOJ-related adjustment are explicitly flagged in the supplied information.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 65% – The most likely direction over the next 24 hours is modestly up, as broad US indices and futures are already higher on the day (S&P 500 +0.88%, Nasdaq +1.31%, S&P futures +1.61%, Nasdaq futures +2.18%) and volatility has compressed sharply (VIX -11.6% to 14.9). Breadth is strong (14 up, 1 down) and the weekly drawdowns in growth indices are relatively shallow, consistent with a rebound rather than exhaustion. While the 10Y yield has ticked up to 4.15% and upcoming earnings (e.g., FedEx, Darden) add event risk, the current cross-asset setup skews toward a continuation of the risk-on tone rather than a reversal.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** ["Traders should watch whether tech leadership persists, particularly in the Nasdaq Composite and QQQ, given their outsized 1-day gains and the tech-driven narrative in recent headlines. Sustained strength in Nasdaq futures relative to S&P futures would confirm that investors remain comfortable adding risk to growth and AI-linked names despite recent bubble concerns, whereas any abrupt reversal there could quickly pressure broader indices. ","On the macro side, attention should remain on global yields and FX following the Bank of Japan's recent rate hike, with the US 10Y Treasury around 4.15% providing a key reference point for equity valuations; a move materially higher from here could temper the current risk-on bid. Sector-wise, results and guidance from FedEx and Darden Restaurants will be important for gauging demand in transport and consumer spending, and any disappointments could rotate leadership away from cyclicals even if the overall market bias stays modestly upward."]

["Equities are in a broadly risk-on mood, with all four major US indices higher on the day: S&P 500 +0.88%, Dow +0.38%, Nasdaq Composite +1.31%, and Russell 2000 +0.86%.
