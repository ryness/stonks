  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-11T20:26:05.348427+00:00">2025-11-11 20:26 UTC</time> (runtime 2m 21s)
  
  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities were mixed-to-positive, with the S&P 500 up 0.25%, the Dow 30 up 0.81%, the Russell 2000 up 0.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.21%, yielding an average index gain of 0.16% on the day. That skew points to a modestly improving risk appetite concentrated in value and cyclicals rather than mega-cap tech.
  
  Futures echoed the split: S&P futures rose 0.31% and Dow futures jumped 1.27%, while Nasdaq futures slipped 0.16% and Russell futures gained 0.13%. Volatility eased, with the VIX at 17.33 (-1.53% 1d), signaling near-term risk-on even as it remains 6.45% higher versus 30 days ago.
  
  Rates were a mild headwind as the 10Y Treasury yield edged up to 4.12% (+0.24% 1d, -0.68% 30d), while the U.S. dollar dipped 0.20% on the day. Commodities leaned constructive for cyclicals, with WTI crude up 1.45% and gold up 0.50% on the day.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market breadth was positive (10 up, 5 down) with an average index change of +0.16%, indicating moderate, broad participation. The VIX eased to 17.33 (-1.53% 1d) but remains 6.45% above its 30-day level, suggesting only tentative risk-taking. The 10Y yield ticked up to 4.12% on the day, a slight drag for duration-sensitive growth areas. Overall, conditions look moderately healthy but uneven, favoring value over tech.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** On the day, the Dow 30 led (+0.81%) alongside Dow futures (+1.27%), while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.21%) and QQQ (-0.23%) lagged. Over the past week, Nasdaq futures (-1.27%) and the Russell 2000 (-0.87%) are notable underperformers, whereas Dow futures (+0.72%) and the S&P 500 (+0.13%) have edged higher.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** Optimism about a U.S. government reopening lifted risk sentiment, with multiple reports (Reuters, Yahoo Finance, CBS News, Barchart) highlighting Senate progress toward ending the shutdown; this backdrop aligns with today’s Dow leadership and lower VIX, a risk-on impulse. Countering that, recent headlines flagged tech valuation and sentiment headwinds, including Fortune’s warnings on extreme valuations and Yahoo’s note on the worst tech sell-off since April; that aligns with the Nasdaq’s softness today (-0.21% 1d) and weaker 7-day readings (Nasdaq futures -1.27%).
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** Potential final Congressional actions and headlines on the U.S. government funding deal over the next 24 hours—positive if passage is confirmed, negative if delayed or fails. No other specific macro data or Fed events are identified in the provided sources.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** up 62%: Broad indices and futures skew higher (S&P 500 +0.25%, Dow 30 +0.81%; ES +0.31%, YM +1.27%) with VIX lower (-1.53% 1d) and supportive shutdown-reopening headlines; tech softness (Nasdaq -0.21%) and a small uptick in the 10Y to 4.12% temper conviction.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch S&P futures around 6,877.75 (last) versus 6,856.75 (prior reference) and Dow futures near 48,065 (last); holding these levels would corroborate a value-led bid, while slippage back toward prior references would warn of fading momentum. Monitor the growth/value split: QQQ (-0.23% 1d) and Nasdaq futures (25,674.25 last vs 25,714.5 reference) remain fragile, while the Dow 30 (+0.81% 1d) is leading; a continued divergence would favor industrials/cyclicals over mega-cap tech. Track macro proxies into the next session: VIX near 17.33 (down 1.53% 1d) for confirmation of risk-on, the 10Y yield at 4.12% for rate sensitivity, WTI at 61.00 (+1.45% 1d) for energy beta, and shutdown-related Congressional headlines that could swing the tape.
