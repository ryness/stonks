  ## 1. Pulse
  
  Equities show a mixed-to-soft tone with rotation into value: the Dow 30 gained 0.81% while the S&P 500 slipped 0.03%, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.57%, and the Russell 2000 eased 0.05%. On a 7-day view, growth remains the laggard (Nasdaq -1.40%) versus a smaller dip for the S&P 500 (-0.15%), though the 30-day tape is still constructive (S&P +2.12%, Nasdaq +3.23%). This points to fading risk appetite in growth/tech near term while broader indices retain a modest monthly uptrend.
  
  Futures confirm the cross-current: S&P futures are down 0.07% and Nasdaq futures down 0.61% against Dow futures up 0.78%, underscoring a defensive rotation toward value and industrials. Volatility is subdued day-over-day with the VIX down 0.40% to 17.53, but it remains 7.68% higher over 30 days, signaling only tentative risk appetite.
  
  Rates and cross-asset signals are mixed: the 10Y Treasury yield is little changed but up on the day to 4.12% (+0.24%), the US Dollar eased 0.25%, gold firmed 0.18% on the day (+3.44% over 7 days), and WTI crude rose 1.65%. The combination of slightly higher yields, a softer dollar, and firmer haven assets suggests risk appetite is balanced but cautiously fading at the margin.
  
  1.1. **Market Health:** Market breadth is soft with 5 advancing and 10 declining benchmarks, and the average index change over 1 day is -0.08%, indicating modest pressure. The VIX at 17.53 fell 0.40% on the day but is still up 7.68% over 30 days, implying underlying caution despite near-term calm. The 10Y Treasury yield sits near 4.12% and edged up on the day, offering no clear relief from rates. Overall health is mixed-to-fragile: mild downside pressure, negative breadth, and only modest volatility support.
  
  1.2. **Leadership:** Leadership is skewed toward value/cyclicals: the Dow 30 rose 0.81% and Dow futures gained 0.78% on the day, standing out positively. Laggards are in growth/tech, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.57% and QQQ down 0.58% on the day. Over the week, Nasdaq futures (-1.72%) and the Nasdaq Composite (-1.40%) are clear underperformers, while Dow futures (+0.23% 7d) have held up better than peers.
  
  ## 2. Drivers
  
  2.1. **Catalysts:** A tech-led pullback is linked to headlines that tech shares slid after SoftBank sold a stake in Nvidia, which aligns with the day’s weakness in Nasdaq futures (-0.61%) and QQQ (-0.58%). This exerts a risk-off tilt within growth and mega-cap tech, pressuring broader sentiment despite resilience elsewhere. US fiscal headlines remain a swing factor as the House considers a stopgap funding bill to end a shutdown, while other coverage cites optimism around a resolution. Progress here would be risk-on for cyclicals and broad indices (consistent with Dow strength at +0.81%), whereas delays could sap confidence and keep the tape heavy. UK macro prints show unemployment rising to 5% and markets pricing a December rate cut, a mix of growth concern (risk-off) and prospective policy support (risk-on). The global cross-currents dovetail with a softer US Dollar (-0.25% 1d) and firmer gold (+0.18% 1d), reinforcing a cautious but balanced risk tone.
  
  2.2. **Upcoming Triggers:** House consideration of a US stopgap funding bill (policy) could shift risk sentiment; progress would be risk-on for cyclicals and broad indices, while setbacks could be risk-off. Ongoing India Q2 earnings and active IPO calendar (regional equities) may sway Asian risk tone and spill into broader sentiment depending on results and flows.
  
  ## 3. Next 24h
  
  3.1. **Next 24h Bias:** flat 55% Mixed signals point to a range-bound bias: breadth is negative (5 up, 10 down) and the average index change is mildly negative (-0.08%), but the VIX eased to 17.53 and the 10Y is relatively steady near 4.12%. Rotation into the Dow (+0.81%) offsets tech weakness (Nasdaq -0.57%), and futures show the same split (YM +0.78% vs NQ -0.61%), suggesting a balanced near-term tape.
  
  3.2. **Watch List:** Watch tech versus value divergence: Nasdaq futures at 25,557.50 (-0.61% 1d) versus Dow futures at 47,830.00 (+0.78% 1d) and S&P futures at 6,852.25 (-0.07% 1d). If NQ=F continues to lag while ES=F holds near flat, expect a choppy, range-bound session with leadership in industrials/value over mega-cap tech. Monitor volatility and rates as guardrails: VIX near 17.53 staying below 18 would favor chop rather than trend, while the 10Y Treasury holding near 4.12% would limit rate-shock risk. A sustained move higher in VIX or a jump in yields would challenge the flat bias. Track policy and cross-asset cues: headlines on the US stopgap funding bill could quickly swing sentiment, while a softer US Dollar (99.37, -0.25% 1d), firmer gold (4,119.20, +0.18% 1d), and WTI crude (61.12, +1.65% 1d) are signaling a cautious but balanced risk setup; persistence of these moves would support a sideways open-to-close profile.
