  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Roblox Corporation operates an immersive platform for connection and communication across the U.S. and internationally. Its core products are Roblox Client (for users to explore 3D experiences), Roblox Studio (tools for developers/creators to build and operate content), and Roblox Cloud (services and infrastructure that power the platform).
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—Roblox is not profitable, with a -21.7% profit margin and about $952M in net losses over the last four quarters; however, operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.02B) are positive.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are users (players) and developers/creators who build and engage with 3D experiences. The company serves the United States and international markets within electronic gaming and multimedia.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include major gaming and platform peers such as NetEase, Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Take-Two, Capcom, and broader platforms like Alphabet and Meta. Relative ranking among these competitors is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares are in a downtrend, trading below the 20-day average (127.65) and near 7d support around 106.91.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 106.91 looked favorable, while selling into resistance near 134.67 offered better exits. These levels align with the 7d support/resistance range.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2004 and headquartered in San Mateo, Roblox has operated its platform for many years across the U.S. and internationally. It generates strong operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.02B), but still reports GAAP net losses and a negative profit margin. Revenue growth is robust (48%), supporting ongoing operations despite lack of profitability. The long operating history and positive cash flow suggest greater stability than a nascent startup.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing, with Q3 bookings of $1.92B up 70% year over year. Piper Sandler reaffirmed Overweight and sees 60% 2025 bookings growth, citing strong long-term platform prospects.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight a surge on user growth and strong Q3 bookings of $1.92B (+70% Y/Y) despite a net loss per share. Piper Sandler reaffirmed Overweight and projected 60% growth in 2025 bookings, signaling optimism about long-term prospects. Counterpoints included an investor noting he sold RBLX amid “some problems,” while other pieces touted an “incredible reason to buy” and linked Roblox to AI-driven profits. The mixed reactions suggest no clear ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ pattern in the latest coverage.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate spending and outlook held up despite tariff uncertainty, with Roblox raising its bookings forecast. Coverage also notes tariffs are listed as a risk but have limited direct impact on its virtual-goods model in cited reports.
