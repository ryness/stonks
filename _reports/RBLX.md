  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform where users play and create 3D experiences, anchored by the Robux virtual economy. It provides Roblox Studio for creators and the Roblox Client for players, and monetizes by taking a cut of in-experience purchases and selling advertising.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—Roblox is not profitable, with a last-four-quarters net loss of about $952.33M and a -21.7% profit margin, though operating and free cash flow are positive.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are players globally and creators/developers who build experiences on the platform, along with advertisers targeting those audiences. The user base spans kids and teens to adults (a large under-13 cohort per Statista and a growing 17–24 segment per Roblox), across the Electronic Gaming & Multimedia market.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft (Minecraft), Meta, Alphabet/YouTube, Netflix for consumer attention, and Unity for creator tooling. Roblox is positioned as a large user-generated content gaming platform; explicit market rank versus these peers isn’t specified.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down—shares dropped toward support around 100.61 from a recent 134.67 high and remain well below the 20-day average (125.37).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 100.61 support/suggested buy zone looked favorable, while trims or sells near 134.67 resistance/suggested sell zone offered exit points.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox has operated its platform at scale (about 110 million daily active users) and shows positive operating ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.02B), indicating funding capacity. However, it continues to report GAAP net losses and a negative profit margin. Revenue growth is strong (up 48%), which supports ongoing operations, but profitability risk remains.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Roblox is innovating and growing, with strong bookings/engagement highlighted in recent quarters and AI-powered features cited in coverage. A viral hit like ‘Grow a Garden’ driving higher hours and bookings supports this growth narrative.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights strong Q3 growth (revenue up 24% and bookings up sharply) but wider losses that drove a post-earnings pullback. Analysts issued bullish calls, including a Goldman Sachs target of $180 and multiple ‘buy’ arguments, framing the dip as an opportunity. Articles also note AI-driven engagement and the viral ‘Grow a Garden’ boosting hours and bookings. The mixed reaction suggests no clean ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ setup; positive news met selling but was followed by optimistic upgrades.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate limited direct tariff impact so far, with bookings guidance raised despite tariff uncertainty and commentary that virtual goods are less exposed; tariffs are listed among potential risk factors. Overall, recent headlines suggest tariffs have not materially pressured the stock.
