  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — at a 3mo bottom and flagged oversold after a pullback; macro froth visibility is limited, and price is below the 20-DMA/EMA (109.0/116.5) while hugging 7d support at 91.33
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform where users play and create millions of 3D experiences, powered by its Roblox Client and Roblox Studio creator tools. It monetizes through Robux purchases and advertising, taking a cut of in-experience transactions and ad inventory. The company provides tools, publishing, discovery, and safety infrastructure connecting players, creators, and brands.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it posts negative net income (sum -$968.6M; profit margin -21.7%), despite positive operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.01B).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are players (consumers), creators/developers, and advertisers across its global platform. Roblox serves a broadening age mix (more than 55% of users are over 13) and is pursuing international expansion, positioning it in global online gaming and digital advertising markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Unity (U) for developer tools and platforms, and large ecosystems from Meta (META), Alphabet/YouTube (GOOGL/GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). Relative market ranking versus these peers is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid from 98.13 open to 91.70 close and sits near 7d support at 91.33
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 98.05 and especially near support at 91.33 looked favorable; selling into 103.78–105.30 offered exits near recent highs/resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** high
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox is a scaled platform company, not a fly-by-night, with millions of creator-made experiences and a large daily user base. It generates strong cash flows (operating cash flow $1.37B; free cash flow $1.01B), which supports stability. However, it remains GAAP unprofitable with a -21.7% profit margin and cumulative net losses over recent quarters (-$968.6M), which adds risk. Overall, its cash generation and platform scale indicate resilience despite earnings volatility.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — recent reports cite 48% revenue growth and 70% bookings growth alongside new monetization like regional pricing and advertising.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights strong 2025 momentum: 48% revenue growth, 70% bookings growth, and accelerating monetization experiments (regional pricing, advertising). Despite robust Q3 metrics, shares pulled back after the print even as analysts issued upbeat calls and higher targets (e.g., a $180 target and buy-the-dip framing). Commentary also notes an aging user base and international expansion that could reshape the model over the next five years. In buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news terms, the post-earnings dip shows some sell-the-news risk, but follow-on upgrades and 'buy' lists suggest dip-buying rather than a sustained fade.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Headlines indicate limited direct impact: Roblox lifted its bookings outlook even as tariff uncertainty rose, and commentary notes virtual goods temper exposure. Tariffs are cited as a general macro risk rather than a demonstrated drag on results.

## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — at a 3mo bottom and flagged oversold after a pullback; macro froth visibility is limited, and price is below the 20-DMA/EMA (109.0/116.5) while hugging 7d support at 91.33

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform where users play and create millions of 3D experiences, powered by its Roblox Client and Roblox Studio creator tools. It monetizes through Robux purchases and advertising, taking a cut of in-experience transactions and ad inventory. The company provides tools, publishing, discovery, and safety infrastructure connecting players, creators, and brands.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it posts negative net income (sum -$968.6M; profit margin -21.7%), despite positive operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.01B).

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are players (consumers), creators/developers, and advertisers across its global platform. Roblox serves a broadening age mix (more than 55% of users are over 13) and is pursuing international expansion, positioning it in global online gaming and digital advertising markets.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Unity (U) for developer tools and platforms, and large ecosystems from Meta (META), Alphabet/YouTube (GOOGL/GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). Relative market ranking versus these peers is not specified in the provided data.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid from 98.13 open to 91.70 close and sits near 7d support at 91.33

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 98.05 and especially near support at 91.33 looked favorable; selling into 103.78–105.30 offered exits near recent highs/resistance.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** high

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox is a scaled platform company, not a fly-by-night, with millions of creator-made experiences and a large daily user base. It generates strong cash flows (operating cash flow $1.37B; free cash flow $1.01B), which supports stability. However, it remains GAAP unprofitable with a -21.7% profit margin and cumulative net losses over recent quarters (-$968.6M), which adds risk. Overall, its cash generation and platform scale indicate resilience despite earnings volatility.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — recent reports cite 48% revenue growth and 70% bookings growth alongside new monetization like regional pricing and advertising.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights strong 2025 momentum: 48% revenue growth, 70% bookings growth, and accelerating monetization experiments (regional pricing, advertising). Despite robust Q3 metrics, shares pulled back after the print even as analysts issued upbeat calls and higher targets (e.g., a $180 target and buy-the-dip framing). Commentary also notes an aging user base and international expansion that could reshape the model over the next five years. In buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news terms, the post-earnings dip shows some sell-the-news risk, but follow-on upgrades and 'buy' lists suggest dip-buying rather than a sustained fade.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Headlines indicate limited direct impact: Roblox lifted its bookings outlook even as tariff uncertainty rose, and commentary notes virtual goods temper exposure. Tariffs are cited as a general macro risk rather than a demonstrated drag on results.
