  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform where users play and create millions of 3D experiences, powered by the Robux virtual economy. Its segments include Roblox Client for players and Roblox Studio tools/publishing for creators, and it monetizes by taking a cut of in-experience purchases and selling real-world advertising.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—Roblox is not profitable, with recent net losses totaling about $952M and a profit margin of -21.7%; however, it generates positive operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.01B). A timeline to GAAP profitability is not disclosed.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are consumers (players) and creators/development studios, ranging from young gamers to professionals. It serves the online gaming/user-generated content and digital advertising markets, with international expansion highlighted in recent coverage.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Unity (U) in creation tools/platforms and large consumer platforms like Meta, Google/YouTube, Microsoft/Xbox, and Netflix for time-spent and entertainment. Roblox is one of the largest UGC gaming platforms by DAUs, but specific market-share ranking isn’t provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the stock is below its 20-day average (~123) and closed at 106.84 after moving from ~126 resistance toward ~100.60 support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the ~100.60 support looked attractive. Selling into 126.28 resistance or the recent local high near 134.67 offered favorable exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox has operated for years (incorporated in 2004) and runs a large-scale platform with about 110 million daily active users noted in its profile. While GAAP net income remains negative, operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.01B) are strong, supporting liquidity. Profit margin is -21.7%, and detailed balance-sheet metrics aren’t provided here, but cash generation and scale suggest operational stability despite ongoing losses.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Roblox is innovating and growing, with 48% revenue growth, a 70% surge in bookings, and new monetization like regional pricing and immersive advertising alongside international expansion. It is still working toward profitability.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Coverage highlights strong growth (48% revenue, 70% bookings, 151.5M DAUs) and new monetization (regional pricing, advertising), alongside a post‑Q3 pullback and bullish analyst targets (e.g., Goldman $180). Articles frame the pullback as a buying opportunity and compare Roblox favorably versus other stocks. The dip after solid results hints at a sell‑the‑news tone, but quick facts say ‘Sell the news? no,’ indicating mixed sentiment.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate limited direct impact: Roblox raised its bookings outlook as spending defied tariff uncertainty (Reuters), and Barron’s noted tariffs don’t directly affect its virtual goods, though the company lists tariffs as a risk. Overall, tariff news has not materially pressured the stock in the cited coverage.
