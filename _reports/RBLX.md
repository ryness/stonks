  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — historically it’s near-bottom on 3mo and in the middle on 1yr/5yr; macro froth visibility is limited in the provided data; price is in a downtrend and below the 20DMA/EMA/SMA (115.69/119.70/125.80) while sitting between 7d support 98.05 and resistance 108.29.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play platform hosting millions of user-created games and virtual experiences powered by the Robux virtual currency. It provides creator tools and publishing via Roblox Studio, earning revenue by taking a cut of in-experience purchases and by selling real-world advertising space. Core functional areas span the user client/platform, creator tools (Studio), and monetization (marketplace/ads).
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — GAAP net income is negative over the last four quarters (sum -$968.63M, profit margin -21.7%), though operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.01B) are positive; timing to profitability is not provided.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are gamers/users and creators/developers on the platform, with advertisers targeting those audiences. The user base skews increasingly older (over 13 with a fast‑growing 17–24 segment) and spans a global market, with international expansion highlighted. Monetization centers on optional in-experience purchases and advertising.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Unity (U) for creator tools/engine, Microsoft (Minecraft), Meta (META), Alphabet/YouTube (GOOGL/GOOG), and Netflix (NFLX) for attention and platform time. It is a leading user-generated gaming platform, but relative market share or rank versus these peers is not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares slipped from a 7d/local high of 108.29 to a 102.28 close while testing 98.05 support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 100.60 and down to support at 98.05 looked favorable; selling or trimming near 108.29 resistance was prudent.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox is an established platform business with a large daily user base and millions of creator-made experiences. It remains GAAP unprofitable over the last four quarters (net income sum -$968.63M, margin -21.7%). However, operating cash flow ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.01B) are solidly positive, supporting ongoing operations and investment. While detailed balance sheet items aren’t provided here, scale and cash generation suggest a more durable institution than a fly-by-night.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—recent coverage cites 48% revenue growth and a 70% bookings surge alongside initiatives like immersive advertising, regional pricing, and international expansion. It is still working toward profitability while expanding monetization.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent pieces highlight strong momentum: 48% revenue growth, 70% bookings growth, and 151.5M DAUs, plus moves in regional pricing and advertising. Despite a pullback after Q3, analysts were upbeat, including a new Goldman Sachs price target of $180 and multiple bullish features. Forward-looking views emphasize immersive ads, an aging user base, and international expansion, with some comparisons against other recovery names. The post-earnings dip hints at some sell-the-news behavior, though quick facts flag ‘Sell the news? no,’ framing the move more as a buy-the-dip setup.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Limited impact per coverage: Roblox lifted its bookings forecast as spending defied tariff uncertainty, and commentary noted tariffs don’t directly affect virtual goods, though the company still lists tariffs among potential risks.
