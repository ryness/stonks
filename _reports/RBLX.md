  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform where users and professional studios build and play millions of games in a shared virtual universe powered by the Robux currency. It provides creation tools and publishing capabilities for developers, and monetizes by taking a cut of in-experience purchases and by selling advertising inventory.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable, with a -21.7% profit margin and recent net losses, though it generates positive operating cash flow and over $1.0B in free cash flow while working toward profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are gamers and creators, ranging from young users to professional development studios, engaging on its global consumer entertainment platform. Markets include worldwide gaming and digital advertising, with coverage noting an aging user base and international expansion.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Meta, Alphabet/YouTube, Microsoft (Minecraft/Xbox), and Unity, as well as publishers like NetEase, EA, Nintendo, and Take-Two. Relative ranking versus peers is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — shares bounced from ~100.60 support toward ~108.29 resistance, setting a local high near 108.29.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 103.55 (local low/suggested buy zone) looked attractive, while selling or trimming near 108.29 (resistance/suggested sell zone) was a reasonable exit.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox is a large-scale platform with a DAU base exceeding 100 million and a mature creator ecosystem. While GAAP profitability is negative, it produced strong operating cash flow ($1.37B) and over $1.01B in free cash flow, supporting ongoing operations. Its recurring in-experience spending and advertising help cash generation, though persistent net losses moderate overall stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — coverage cites immersive advertising, regional pricing, an aging user base, and international expansion, alongside 48% revenue and 70% bookings growth. It is still working toward profitability.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent pieces highlight strong growth (48% revenue, 70% bookings, and DAUs cited at 151.5 million) and analyst optimism despite a post‑Q3 pullback. One article frames the Q3 dip as a buying opportunity amid upgrades and higher price targets. Other coverage discusses evolution toward immersive ads, older users, and international expansion. The reaction suggests some sell‑the‑news pressure on results, but sentiment leans more toward buy‑the‑dip than sell‑the‑news.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Limited impact so far — Roblox lifted its bookings outlook as spending defied tariff uncertainty, and commentary notes its virtual goods model is relatively insulated, though tariffs remain a cited macro risk.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform where users and professional studios build and play millions of games in a shared virtual universe powered by the Robux currency. It provides creation tools and publishing capabilities for developers, and monetizes by taking a cut of in-experience purchases and by selling advertising inventory.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable, with a -21.7% profit margin and recent net losses, though it generates positive operating cash flow and over $1.0B in free cash flow while working toward profitability.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are gamers and creators, ranging from young users to professional development studios, engaging on its global consumer entertainment platform. Markets include worldwide gaming and digital advertising, with coverage noting an aging user base and international expansion.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Meta, Alphabet/YouTube, Microsoft (Minecraft/Xbox), and Unity, as well as publishers like NetEase, EA, Nintendo, and Take-Two. Relative ranking versus peers is not specified in the provided data.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — shares bounced from ~100.60 support toward ~108.29 resistance, setting a local high near 108.29.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 103.55 (local low/suggested buy zone) looked attractive, while selling or trimming near 108.29 (resistance/suggested sell zone) was a reasonable exit.
