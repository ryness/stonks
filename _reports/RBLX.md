  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform and virtual universe where users play and create games, powered by the Robux digital economy. It provides creators with tools, publishing, and monetization, and earns revenue by taking a cut of in-game purchases and from advertising across millions of user-made experiences.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable, with a negative profit margin (-21.7%) and about -$952M in net losses over recent quarters; despite this, operating and free cash flow are positive.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are consumers/gamers, a wide spectrum of creators from hobbyists to professional studios, and advertisers seeking in-world placements. It serves the electronic gaming and multimedia market and digital advertising, operating a large-scale U.S.-based platform with roughly 110 million daily active users.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Unity (U), Meta (META), Google/YouTube (GOOGL/GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). Specific market-share or ranking data are not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with shares at 107.66 below the 20-day average (~127.65), RSI near 34, negative MACD, and testing support around 106.10.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 125.81 (suggested buy zone) or on dips toward support around 106.10 looked favorable; selling into strength near 134.67 aligned with resistance/suggested sell zone.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox is a scaled platform with about 110 million daily active users and generates substantial operating ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.02B). However, it continues to report GAAP net losses and a negative profit margin, which tempers its financial stability. Its model is diversified across in-game purchases and advertising tied to user-generated content. Overall, its scale and cash generation provide resilience despite ongoing losses.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, with AI-powered features and viral content driving engagement and monetization; Q2 2025 saw platform hours up 58% and bookings up 51%. Despite growth, profitability has not yet been achieved.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights surging engagement and bookings, including a viral 'Grow a Garden' event with over 20 million concurrent players and Q2 2025 platform hours up 58% and bookings up 51%. Other reports note strong Q3 2025 user growth and bookings but wider-than-expected losses. The earnings release prompted an 11% sell-off as investors focused on losses, suggesting a sell-the-news reaction despite growth narratives. AI-driven features are cited as boosting user engagement and revenue potential.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Roblox operates a free-to-play online platform and virtual universe where users play and create games, powered by the Robux digital economy. It provides creators with tools, publishing, and monetization, and earns revenue by taking a cut of in-game purchases and from advertising across millions of user-made experiences.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable, with a negative profit margin (-21.7%) and about -$952M in net losses over recent quarters; despite this, operating and free cash flow are positive.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are consumers/gamers, a wide spectrum of creators from hobbyists to professional studios, and advertisers seeking in-world placements. It serves the electronic gaming and multimedia market and digital advertising, operating a large-scale U.S.-based platform with roughly 110 million daily active users.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Unity (U), Meta (META), Google/YouTube (GOOGL/GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). Specific market-share or ranking data are not provided.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with shares at 107.66 below the 20-day average (~127.65), RSI near 34, negative MACD, and testing support around 106.10.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 125.81 (suggested buy zone) or on dips toward support around 106.10 looked favorable; selling into strength near 134.67 aligned with resistance/suggested sell zone.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Roblox is a scaled platform with about 110 million daily active users and generates substantial operating ($1.37B) and free cash flow ($1.02B). However, it continues to report GAAP net losses and a negative profit margin, which tempers its financial stability. Its model is diversified across in-game purchases and advertising tied to user-generated content. Overall, its scale and cash generation provide resilience despite ongoing losses.

3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, with AI-powered features and viral content driving engagement and monetization; Q2 2025 saw platform hours up 58% and bookings up 51%. Despite growth, profitability has not yet been achieved.

## 4. Context
