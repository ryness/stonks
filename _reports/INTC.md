  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Intel designs and manufactures microprocessors and platforms for the global PC and data center markets, having pioneered the x86 architecture. It is reinvigorating its manufacturing through Intel Foundry while developing leading-edge products within its Intel Products segment.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes: Intel is marginally profitable, with a positive net income sum of $198M and a ~0.37% profit margin, though free cash flow is negative.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are PC OEMs, cloud/data center operators, and network/edge equipment makers, along with foundry clients. Intel serves global markets from the U.S. across segments including Client Computing, Data Center & AI, Network & Edge, and Foundry.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitors include AMD and Nvidia, with Qualcomm, Apple, and others active in adjacent segments. Intel remains the market share leader in CPUs for PCs and servers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, as the price slid from a local high near 39.53 to 35.91 and trades near 35.45 support below the 20DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 36.80 or closer to 35.45 support looked favorable; selling into 39.53–39.84 resistance offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Intel is a long-established U.S. semiconductor leader and the market-share leader in PC and server CPUs. It generated strong operating cash flow ($8.57B) but has negative free cash flow (-$4.42B), reflecting heavy investment. Profitability is thin (profit margin ~0.37% with $198M cumulative net income) yet positive. Its scale, diversified segments, and ongoing manufacturing initiatives support overall stability rather than a fly-by-night profile.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Intel appears to be innovating and investing, reinvigorating manufacturing via Intel Foundry and developing leading-edge products, with 2025 coverage noting a comeback tied to strategic investments and AI market growth.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights Intel as one of three stocks mounting an epic 2025 comeback after 2024 struggles, citing strategic investments and AI tailwinds. Broader semiconductor headlines emphasize Nvidia and AMD’s AI strength, while market pieces discuss earnings signals and volatility. Against this backdrop, Intel-specific momentum is framed more as recovery than hype-driven spikes. Consistent with the quick facts, there’s no clear ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ setup (buy the rumor: no; sell the news: no).
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have driven volatility, including an April 2025 selloff where Intel shares fell about 7% amid tariff concerns, while some commentary suggested pro-U.S. semiconductor policies could be a benefit. Overall, impacts appear mixed and episodic.
