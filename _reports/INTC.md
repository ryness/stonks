  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — in a 7d downtrend with shares at 34.33 near support at 33.57 and below the 20-DMA (38.04), SMA (35.04), and 7d resistance 39.53; macro froth visibility is limited in the provided data, while 3mo/1yr/5yr positioning is 'middle'.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Intel designs and manufactures microprocessors and related semiconductors for global PC and data center markets, having pioneered the x86 architecture. It operates through Intel Products (client and data center CPUs and platforms) and is reinvigorating its Intel Foundry manufacturing business. The company remains focused on advancing process technology aligned to Moore’s law.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes, marginally — trailing net income totals $198M with a 0.37% profit margin, though free cash flow is -$4.42B.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are in the personal computer and data center/server end markets. Intel serves global markets, with leadership in CPUs across PC and server segments. Its efforts also include expanding manufacturing services via Intel Foundry.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include AMD and Nvidia, among others; Intel remains the market share leader in CPUs for both PC and server end markets.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — fell toward 34.33 from a recent 36.80–39.53 range, approaching 7d support at 33.57.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 36.80 and selling near 39.53 stood out per the suggested zones; deeper support at 33.57 offers an opportunistic bid level.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Intel is a long-standing semiconductor leader and the market share leader in CPUs for PC and server end markets. It generated $8.57B in operating cash flow, though free cash flow was -$4.42B, indicating heavy investment needs. Trailing net income is positive at $198M with a slim 0.37% profit margin. Overall, this points to an established, durable company undergoing investment-driven cash burn rather than a fly-by-night operator.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — it is reinvigorating Intel Foundry and developing leading-edge products, and recent reports cite improvements in its foundry business with support from SoftBank, the U.S. government, and Nvidia.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent pieces highlight AI supply constraints centered on advanced packaging at TSMC, SoftBank unloading its Nvidia stake ahead of earnings, and Intel’s own sharp rebound tied to progress in its foundry backed by SoftBank, the U.S. government, and Nvidia. Another headline notes David Tepper sold out of Intel, while Tower Semiconductor rallied on strong results. Taken together, sentiment is mixed: supply-chain tightness and some high-profile selling could temper momentum even as Intel-specific progress draws interest. Given this mix, the 'buy the rumor, sell the news' setup looks uncertain, and quick facts flag 'no' for both.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff news has produced conflicting impacts: one report cited Intel shares hitting a 16-year low amid a tariff-driven selloff (Apr 9, 2025). Other commentary suggests potential benefits from pro-U.S. semiconductor tariffs, so the net effect is mixed.

## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — in a 7d downtrend with shares at 34.33 near support at 33.57 and below the 20-DMA (38.04), SMA (35.04), and 7d resistance 39.53; macro froth visibility is limited in the provided data, while 3mo/1yr/5yr positioning is 'middle'.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Intel designs and manufactures microprocessors and related semiconductors for global PC and data center markets, having pioneered the x86 architecture. It operates through Intel Products (client and data center CPUs and platforms) and is reinvigorating its Intel Foundry manufacturing business. The company remains focused on advancing process technology aligned to Moore’s law.

1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes, marginally — trailing net income totals $198M with a 0.37% profit margin, though free cash flow is -$4.42B.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are in the personal computer and data center/server end markets. Intel serves global markets, with leadership in CPUs across PC and server segments. Its efforts also include expanding manufacturing services via Intel Foundry.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include AMD and Nvidia, among others; Intel remains the market share leader in CPUs for both PC and server end markets.

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — fell toward 34.33 from a recent 36.80–39.53 range, approaching 7d support at 33.57.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 36.80 and selling near 39.53 stood out per the suggested zones; deeper support at 33.57 offers an opportunistic bid level.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Intel is a long-standing semiconductor leader and the market share leader in CPUs for PC and server end markets. It generated $8.57B in operating cash flow, though free cash flow was -$4.42B, indicating heavy investment needs. Trailing net income is positive at $198M with a slim 0.37% profit margin. Overall, this points to an established, durable company undergoing investment-driven cash burn rather than a fly-by-night operator.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — it is reinvigorating Intel Foundry and developing leading-edge products, and recent reports cite improvements in its foundry business with support from SoftBank, the U.S. government, and Nvidia.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent pieces highlight AI supply constraints centered on advanced packaging at TSMC, SoftBank unloading its Nvidia stake ahead of earnings, and Intel’s own sharp rebound tied to progress in its foundry backed by SoftBank, the U.S. government, and Nvidia. Another headline notes David Tepper sold out of Intel, while Tower Semiconductor rallied on strong results. Taken together, sentiment is mixed: supply-chain tightness and some high-profile selling could temper momentum even as Intel-specific progress draws interest. Given this mix, the 'buy the rumor, sell the news' setup looks uncertain, and quick facts flag 'no' for both.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff news has produced conflicting impacts: one report cited Intel shares hitting a 16-year low amid a tariff-driven selloff (Apr 9, 2025). Other commentary suggests potential benefits from pro-U.S. semiconductor tariffs, so the net effect is mixed.
