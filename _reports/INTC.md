  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Intel designs and manufactures microprocessors and related semiconductors for PCs and data centers, having pioneered the x86 architecture and led advancements in process technology. It operates across Client Computing, Data Center & AI, Network & Edge, and Intel Foundry, aiming to reinvigorate manufacturing while advancing its product roadmap.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — despite a slim reported profit margin of ~0.37%, recent periods sum to a net loss of about $20.5B with negative free cash flow, and the timing of sustained profitability is unknown.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are PC OEMs and data center/server buyers in the global personal computer and data center markets. Intel remains the market share leader in CPUs in both PC and server end markets, serving worldwide enterprise and cloud workloads.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include AMD and Nvidia, among others. Intel remains the market share leader in CPUs for PCs and servers versus these peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with lower highs around 39.84 and repeated tests near 36.80–36.63 support while closing 38.45 below 7d resistance at 40.83.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 36.80 (suggested buy zone/support) and selling into 39.84–40.83 (local high/7d resistance) offered favorable entries and exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Intel is a long-established U.S. semiconductor company and a component of major indices like the S&P 500, with enduring leadership in PC and server CPUs. While it retains scale and industry relevance, recent results show net losses and negative free cash flow. Operating cash flow is positive, indicating ongoing business strength despite investment and restructuring pressures. Overall, it is a mature, systemically important chipmaker rather than a fly-by-night entity.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — Intel is investing to reinvigorate its Intel Foundry business and advance leading-edge products, including launching Core Ultra 200H/HX mobile processors. Its roadmap and AI positioning suggest active innovation.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines note hedge fund interest, with David Tepper holding Intel as an AI-related deep-value pick, and multiple pieces framing Intel as a long-term AI infrastructure buy. Broader context highlights Nvidia’s dominance, while China’s reported ban on foreign AI chips in certain state-funded data centers pressures peers like Nvidia and AMD. These developments paint a mixed backdrop of AI enthusiasm and policy risk. Consistent with the supplied quick facts, there’s little indication of a near-term “buy the rumor, sell the news” setup (Buy the rumor? no; Sell the news? no).
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have pressured the stock, including a noted tariff-driven selloff to 16-year lows, and Intel explicitly flags tariffs and export controls as risks. Net impact in recent coverage appears negative for sentiment and volatility.
