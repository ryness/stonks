  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares sit mid-range versus 1yr/5yr per quick facts; macro froth visibility is limited in the provided data; price is below the 20-DMA (37.54) and near 7d support (32.89) amid a downtrend
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Intel designs and manufactures microprocessors for the global personal computer and data center markets. It pioneered the x86 architecture and remains the market share leader in CPUs for PCs and servers. The company is reinvigorating its chip manufacturing via Intel Foundry while developing leading-edge products within its Intel Products segment.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — marginally profitable with $198M net income sum and a 0.37% profit margin, though free cash flow is negative.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Intel serves customers in the personal computer and data center/server end markets. Its reach is global, and it is a United States–based company.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Apple, Micron and other large chip and platform vendors; Intel remains the market share leader in CPUs for both PC and server end markets.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d trend is down and price tested 7d support at 32.89 while remaining below the 20-DMA 37.54.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Dips near the suggested buy zone/local low around 33.57 and 7d support at 32.89 were buys; bounces toward the suggested sell zone/local high near 36.68 and 7d resistance at 37.31 were sells.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Intel is a long-standing, leading semiconductor company and the CPU market share leader in PCs and servers. Recent financials show slim profitability (profit margin ~0.37%, net income sum $198M) and positive operating cash flow ($8.57B) but negative free cash flow (-$4.42B), consistent with heavy investment. The company is reinvigorating manufacturing through Intel Foundry. Overall, this points to a durable institution in an investment-heavy phase.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and investing — Intel is rebuilding manufacturing via Intel Foundry and pursuing leading-edge products, with coverage highlighting potential benefits from AI packaging bottlenecks.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights AI supply bottlenecks at TSMC and suggests Intel could benefit as an alternative manufacturer. Nvidia’s record AI-driven revenue underscores strong sector demand, while another piece points to advanced-packaging constraints driving the bottleneck. An IoT forecast to 2030 signals secular tech tailwinds. In this context, the quick facts say “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” implying limited near-term rumor/news trading setups for INTC.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate tariffs and export controls have pressured the stock, including a noted selloff tied to tariff fears. An Intel press item references tariffs/export controls as impacting business conditions, suggesting continued sensitivity to such policies.
