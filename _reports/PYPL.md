  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** PayPal provides digital payment solutions for online transactions, serving merchants and consumers through its PayPal wallet and checkout services. It also owns Venmo for peer-to-peer payments and had 434 million active accounts at the end of 2024. The company’s offerings span online payments and newer services such as buy now, pay later in certain markets.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — PayPal is profitable, with a ~15% profit margin and $4.92B in net income over the last four quarters, alongside positive earnings growth and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Its primary customers are merchants (online sellers and platforms) and consumers using digital wallets and P2P payments. PayPal operates globally, processing transactions in more than 200 markets and over 100 currencies, with significant presence in U.S. and international e-commerce and digital payments.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Apple (Apple Pay), Visa, Block (Square), Adyen, Affirm, Amazon/Shopify payment offerings, and others. Third-party estimates cite PayPal as a leading online payments provider by market share.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slipped from a local high near 67.99 to 65.18 and remains below the 20-day moving average (68.26).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 64.78 and selling near 67.99–68.21 resistance offered favorable entries/exits. The range trade between support and resistance dominated the period.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** PayPal is a mature fintech platform spun off from eBay in 2015 and now serves 434 million active accounts, indicating substantial scale. It generates solid operating cash flow ($6.43B) and free cash flow ($3.13B), with a consistent profit margin near 15%. Positive earnings growth and cash generation support balance-sheet resilience. Overall, it appears as a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operator.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is actively innovating, expanding BNPL offerings (e.g., no-fee BNPL in Canada) and launching AI-driven “agentic commerce” services. Venmo feature updates and ongoing crypto functionality via PayPal also signal continued product evolution.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlighted PayPal as a cheap growth stock and noted its role as a venue to buy and sell cryptocurrency. Company updates included Venmo Stash and a no-fee BNPL offering in Canada, plus new AI-driven “agentic commerce” services. Tariff-related headlines weighed on fintech sentiment at times. Given the quick facts indicating “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” recent moves did not exhibit a classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news pattern.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have pressured PYPL as investors worry about weaker consumer spending and macro risks, with multiple reports citing fintech sell-offs on tariff concerns. The effect has been sentiment-driven rather than company-specific policy impacts.
