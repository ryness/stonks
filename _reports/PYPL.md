  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are near 1yr/5yr near-bottom and flagged oversold, suggesting a potential dip-buy; macro froth visibility is limited, and price sits well below the 20-DMA/SMA (~67–68) while hovering just above 7d/30d support at 60.47.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** PayPal provides electronic payment solutions for merchants and consumers, enabling online checkout, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer transfers via Venmo. It offers tools like fraud protection and transaction processing across its payments ecosystem. Spun off from eBay in 2015, it had 434 million active accounts at the end of 2024.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable with ~15% profit margin, ~$4.92B TTM net income, and ~$3.13B in free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are merchants and consumers transacting online and via Venmo for P2P payments. It serves global e-commerce and digital payments markets, processing transactions in more than 200 markets and over 100 currencies.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Apple (Apple Pay), Visa, Affirm (BNPL), Shopify/Shop Pay, Amazon, and Coinbase. Reported estimates place PayPal as a leading online payments player with roughly mid-40% market share, positioning it among the top providers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the price retreated from the 7d local high 67.99 toward support 60.47 and sits below the 20-DMA (67.21).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Attractive entries were near 64.78 and especially around support at 60.47; prudent sells were near the 67.99 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** PayPal has operated as a standalone public company since its 2015 spinoff and serves 434 million active accounts, signaling scale and durability. It posts consistent profits (~$4.92B TTM net income) with strong operating cash flow (~$6.43B) and free cash flow (~$3.13B. These metrics and its entrenched payments platform indicate a relatively stable institution, not a fly-by-night firm.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating — recent moves include PayPal USD (with 4% interest and free transfers), AI-driven “agentic commerce” services, and new Venmo features plus no-fee BNPL expansion to Canada, indicating active product development and growth efforts.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent pieces frame PayPal as an undervalued growth stock and spotlight product updates like PayPal USD’s 4% yield, AI-driven “agentic commerce,” Venmo Stash, and no-fee BNPL expansion to Canada. Additional coverage argues the stock deserves a second look before year-end. Quick facts show “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” suggesting attention is product/value-driven rather than rumor-driven, lowering classic ‘sell the news’ risk. Stablecoin comparisons add context but no imminent rumor catalyst.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines pressured fintechs including PayPal on fears of weaker consumer spending (CNBC 4/3/2025; CNBC 4/28/2025), weighing on sentiment and the stock. Net effect in the provided data: a bearish overhang from tariffs rather than a direct operational impact.
