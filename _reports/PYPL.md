  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** PayPal operates a global two-sided digital payments platform connecting merchants and consumers for online and in-person transactions, money transfers, and withdrawals. It offers solutions under the PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, Zettle, Hyperwallet, Honey, and Paidy brands, supporting funding via bank accounts, balances, cards, consumer credit, cryptocurrencies, and stored value.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes: PayPal is profitable, with ~15% profit margin, positive net income totaling about $4.68B, and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are merchants and consumers using PayPal, Venmo, Braintree, and related services to pay, get paid, and move money. It serves global markets across online and in-person commerce with multiple funding sources including bank accounts, balances, cards, credit products, crypto, and stored value.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors cited include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase; PayPal differentiates as a scaled two-sided digital payments network. Relative market ranking is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, trading below the 20-day average (70.07) and near support at 67.62 after a local high at 79.21.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 67.62 looked favorable, while selling or trimming near resistance around 79.21 offered better exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 1998, PayPal is an established payments company with a large, global two-sided network. It has consistent profitability (~15% margin) and cumulative net income of about $4.68B across recent periods. Cash generation is strong, with $6.43B in operating cash flow and $3.13B in free cash flow. These factors and its portfolio of well-known brands indicate a relatively stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operation.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing, evidenced by its OpenAI partnership and solid fundamentals. Revenue grew 7.3% and earnings 23.6%, signaling active execution.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Headlines highlight PayPal’s deal with OpenAI, enabling ChatGPT users to buy products and marking a push into AI. Reports also note that shares surged on the OpenAI partnership. Broader sector coverage points to rapid digital payments innovation in Singapore’s ecosystem. In the ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ context, quick facts show ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? no,’ suggesting the typical pattern did not strongly apply here.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
