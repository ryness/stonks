  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** PayPal provides digital payments and commerce solutions for merchants and consumers, centered on online transactions via its global digital wallet and checkout platform. It operates PayPal and Venmo for person-to-person payments and offers services like Pay in 4 BNPL and merchant processing. The company had 434 million active accounts at the end of 2024.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—PayPal is profitable, with ~15% profit margin, positive net income totaling about $4.68B over the last four quarters, and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are merchants of all sizes and consumers, including Venmo users. It processes transactions in more than 200 markets and over 100 currencies, serving global e-commerce and digital payments.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Apple Pay (AAPL), Block/Square (SQ), Stripe, Adyen, Visa (V), Affirm (AFRM), Amazon Pay, and Shopify (SHOP). Sources cite PayPal as a leading player in online payment processing by market share.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid toward 67.62 support and closed below the 20-day average, matching the stated downtrend.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 67.62 (intraday low ~67.71) looked attractive, while selling into resistance near 79.21 was the clearest exit level.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** PayPal has operated independently since its 2015 spin-off from eBay and serves 434 million active accounts, indicating significant scale and durability. It generates consistent profits (~15% margin) and strong cash flow ($6.43B operating, $3.13B free cash flow). The business is globally diversified across more than 200 markets and over 100 currencies. Although the stock trades near its 5-year lower range, the company appears stable rather than fly-by-night.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing: recent moves include becoming the first payments wallet integrated into ChatGPT via an OpenAI partnership and launching Agentic Commerce services, alongside 7% revenue and 23.6% earnings growth.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight a first-ever dividend and strong Q3 results (7% revenue growth), plus a strategic partnership making PayPal the first payments wallet in ChatGPT, which boosted shares. PayPal also announced Agentic Commerce services to power AI-driven shopping. Coverage emphasizes AI partnerships with OpenAI and Google and expanding checkout capabilities. These developments suggest moves were driven by announced news rather than rumor, so the typical 'buy the rumor, sell the news' pattern was limited.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate tariff headlines weighed on fintechs, with PayPal shares falling on concerns tariffs could dampen consumer spending ahead of earnings. Impacts appear indirect—via consumer demand—rather than from direct tariffs on payment services.
