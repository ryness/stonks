  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are near the 3mo 'bottom' and just above 7d support at 210.77 (within the suggested buy zone 214.5); AI-froth cues are mixed (headlines warn market faith may be tested while others dismiss bubble worries), and price is in a downtrend far below the 20-DMA 245.25 and EMA/SMA 258.03/276.66
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oracle provides enterprise applications and infrastructure across on‑premises, cloud, and hybrid deployment models. It pioneered the first commercial SQL relational database and also sells ERP platforms and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure that supports large language model training and inference. Its offerings target high-volume online transaction processing and enterprise IT workloads.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it posted four straight profitable quarters totaling $12.44B in net income with a 21.08% profit margin, though free cash flow was negative despite strong operating cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Its primary customers are large enterprises and institutions, as its database is commonly used by the world's largest companies for high-volume transaction workloads. Markets span enterprise applications and cloud infrastructure globally, including AI training and inferencing workloads.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Salesforce, SAP, IBM, Adobe, and NVIDIA. Oracle is a top-tier incumbent in databases and enterprise applications among mega-cap software and infrastructure providers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price fell from a prior close of 225.53 to ~215 and remains below 7d resistance at 236.81
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 214.5 (close to 7d support 210.77) offered favorable entry. Selling around 227.05 up to 236.81 aligned with the local high and 7d resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 1977, Oracle has decades of operating history and scale typical of a stable institution. It is a mega-cap company (CNBC lists market cap around $713B) with consistent profitability, including $12.44B in net income over the last four quarters and a 21% margin. Operating cash flow is strong at $21.53B, although free cash flow was negative, suggesting heavy investment. Overall, its longevity, cash generation, and entrenched enterprise footprint indicate stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Oracle appears to be innovating and growing, with 12.2% revenue growth and cloud infrastructure playing an increasing role in LLM training and inference. It is also highlighted among top AI-related stocks in recent coverage.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines are dominated by broader AI context: Nvidia reported record revenue and dismissed bubble concerns, while other coverage says upcoming earnings and jobs data will test market faith in AI. Oracle-specific mention includes a piece naming Oracle as one of three top AI stocks to buy now. This mixed backdrop suggests enthusiasm tempered by caution, which fits the quick facts showing no strong ‘buy the rumor’ or ‘sell the news’ signal. For ORCL, limited direct news flow implies macro AI sentiment could sway moves more than company-specific catalysts in the near term.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
