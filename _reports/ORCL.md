  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — AI-related unwind and tight liquidity signal macro froth risk, and despite a 3mo 'near-bottom' reading the 7d trend is down; shares at 222.85 sit well below the 20-DMA/EMA/SMA (256.46/262.62/279.51) and under 7d resistance 249.07, with better risk near support 210.77
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oracle provides enterprise applications and infrastructure across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid models. It pioneered the first commercial SQL-based relational database, and also sells ERP platforms and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure that increasingly supports large language model training and inferencing.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — Oracle is profitable with a ~21.08% profit margin and consistent positive GAAP net income, though recent free cash flow was negative while operating cash flow remained strong.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Its primary customers are large enterprises, including many of the world’s largest companies that rely on Oracle databases for high-volume transaction processing. Oracle serves enterprise IT needs across on‑prem, cloud, and hybrid deployments, including workloads tied to AI training and inferencing on OCI.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in cloud infrastructure and Microsoft, Salesforce, and others in enterprise applications; Oracle remains a major incumbent in databases and enterprise apps per its long-standing role with large enterprises.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price closed at 222.85 below the 20-DMA 256.46 and slipped under the suggested buy zone 232.35 toward 7d support 210.77
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 210.77 (7d support) or the suggested buy zone around 232.35 offered better entries; selling into 247.24 (suggested sell/local high) was a favorable exit.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** high
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 1977, Oracle is a long-tenured, large enterprise software provider, not a fly‑by‑night operation. It is profitable with a ~21% margin and has generated strong operating cash flow (~$21.53B), though recent free cash flow was negative. The company supports mission-critical systems for many of the world’s largest companies, indicating durable demand. Recent high volume and volatility reflect market conditions rather than institutional fragility.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Oracle is actively innovating in cloud and AI, with OCI playing a growing role in LLM training/inferencing and revenue up 12.2% year over year. However, headlines flag concerns about AI deal quality and margins, and earnings growth was roughly flat.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Headlines highlight broad AI unwind and liquidity strain pressuring tech, while specific commentary questions Oracle’s AI strategy, margins, and the credibility of a large backlog. At the same time, another piece frames Oracle as a potential dark horse in enterprise AI, citing a massive OpenAI-related cloud deal. Macro pieces note the Nasdaq’s worst November since 2008 amid AI constraints and execution challenges. Given mixed sentiment and elevated scrutiny, any hype-driven pops risk fading, though quick facts currently flag ‘Sell the news? no.’
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — AI-related unwind and tight liquidity signal macro froth risk, and despite a 3mo 'near-bottom' reading the 7d trend is down; shares at 222.85 sit well below the 20-DMA/EMA/SMA (256.46/262.62/279.51) and under 7d resistance 249.07, with better risk near support 210.77

1.1. **Activities:** Oracle provides enterprise applications and infrastructure across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid models.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in cloud infrastructure and Microsoft, Salesforce, and others in enterprise applications; Oracle remains a major incumbent in databases and enterprise apps per its long-standing role with large enterprises.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** high

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 1977, Oracle is a long-tenured, large enterprise software provider, not a fly‑by‑night operation. It is profitable with a ~21% margin and has generated strong operating cash flow (~$21.53B), though recent free cash flow was negative.
