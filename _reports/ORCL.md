  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oracle provides enterprise software and infrastructure across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployment models. Core offerings include the Oracle Database, enterprise resource planning applications, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which supports high-volume transaction processing and increasingly large language model training and inference. It also offers hardware/engineered systems tied to its cloud and applications stack.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Oracle is profitable, with ~21% profit margin and positive GAAP net income (e.g., ~$2.9B most recently) alongside strong operating cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Oracle primarily serves large enterprises that rely on relational databases, ERP suites, and cloud infrastructure for high-volume online transaction processing and AI workloads. Its customer base includes the world’s largest companies across industries, delivered via on-premises, cloud, and hybrid markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Salesforce, with Nvidia relevant in AI infrastructure. The data does not specify Oracle’s rank versus these peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with shares closing at 236.15 below the 20-DMA (~268.49), setting a lower high (247.24) and testing support intraday near 228.89.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked better near 232.35 and the 228.89 support; sells/ trims appeared near 247.24 with overhead resistance around 265.62.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 1977, Oracle has a multi-decade operating history as a core provider of enterprise databases and applications. It delivers consistent profitability (~21% margin) and strong operating cash flow (~$21.5B), though free cash flow is currently negative, indicating heavy investment. Market data categorize ORCL as a mega-cap, reflecting substantial scale. Balance-sheet specifics (e.g., leverage) are not detailed in the provided data, but diversified software and cloud revenues support overall stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Oracle is actively innovating, with OCI and applications increasingly used for LLM training/inference and AI workloads. Recent coverage highlights AI/cloud-driven expansion and partnerships (e.g., with AMD and power providers for AI data centers).
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines center on AI infrastructure ties: Energy Transfer noted gas supply agreements with Oracle for AI data centers, while Bloom Energy surged on AI infrastructure partnerships with Oracle and Brookfield. AMD coverage cites growth potential supported by partnerships with OpenAI and Oracle. Additional reports say Oracle is entering its strongest growth phase on AI/cloud demand and was called a “decade stock” by Guggenheim despite volatility. Given partner-related rallies, the adage suggests potential for ‘sell the news’ elsewhere, but Oracle’s quick facts indicate “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” implying limited immediate trading edge from headlines.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
