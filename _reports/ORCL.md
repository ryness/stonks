  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 3mo positioning is near-bottom while 1yr/5yr are middle; AI-related unwind and tight liquidity raise froth risk, and shares sit well below the 20-DMA/EMA/SMA and between 7d support 210.82 and resistance 249.07.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oracle provides enterprise applications and infrastructure delivered on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid models. Its core products include the Oracle SQL-based relational database, enterprise resource planning platforms, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for high-volume transaction processing and increasingly for large language model training and inferencing.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it generated $12.44B in net income with ~21.1% profit margin, though free cash flow was negative over the period.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are large enterprises running databases, ERP, and cloud infrastructure for high-volume transaction processing and LLM workloads. Markets span enterprise applications across finance, HR, supply chain, sales, and marketing.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Oracle competes with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in cloud infrastructure and with Salesforce and SAP in enterprise applications, alongside IBM in databases; it is a long-standing database and ERP incumbent but specific ranking is not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price fell from a 7d local high of 247.24 toward 225.95 and remains below the 20-DMA 256.62 amid a downtrend label.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near ~232.35 (suggested buy zone/near recent lows) and sells near 247.24–249.07 (sell zone/7d resistance) were the notable levels.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Oracle was founded in 1977 and pioneered the first commercial SQL-based RDBMS, signaling long operating history. It is consistently profitable with recent net income of $12.44B and ~21% profit margin. Operating cash flow is strong at ~$21.53B, though free cash flow was negative. Overall, it appears to be a mature, stable enterprise software company rather than a fly-by-night outfit.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Oracle is actively investing in cloud infrastructure for AI training and inferencing and posted 12.2% revenue growth, indicating ongoing innovation. Headlines note very large AI cloud deals alongside scrutiny of backlog quality and margins.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Reports flag an AI-related unwind and tight liquidity across markets, with the Nasdaq 100 facing its worst November since 2008. An analyst criticized Oracle’s AI push as low-margin and questioned a large backlog, while another piece cast Oracle as a potential dark horse after a massive OpenAI cloud deal. Broader AI infrastructure supply constraints are cited as drivers of sector volatility. In this setting, chasing rumors looks risky, and reactions may skew toward skepticism rather than classic ‘sell the news’ spikes.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** No direct stock impact from tariffs is specified; available items note Oracle tools that help customers navigate tariff complexity rather than effects on ORCL shares.

![Oracle Corp logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/ORCL.svg)


## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 3mo positioning is near-bottom while 1yr/5yr are middle; AI-related unwind and tight liquidity raise froth risk, and shares sit well below the 20-DMA/EMA/SMA and between 7d support 210.82 and resistance 249.07.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Oracle provides enterprise applications and infrastructure delivered on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid models. Its core products include the Oracle SQL-based relational database, enterprise resource planning platforms, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for high-volume transaction processing and increasingly for large language model training and inferencing.

1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it generated $12.44B in net income with ~21.1% profit margin, though free cash flow was negative over the period.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are large enterprises running databases, ERP, and cloud infrastructure for high-volume transaction processing and LLM workloads. Markets span enterprise applications across finance, HR, supply chain, sales, and marketing.

1.4. **Competition:** Oracle competes with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in cloud infrastructure and with Salesforce and SAP in enterprise applications, alongside IBM in databases; it is a long-standing database and ERP incumbent but specific ranking is not provided.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price fell from a 7d local high of 247.24 toward 225.95 and remains below the 20-DMA 256.62 amid a downtrend label.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near ~232.35 (suggested buy zone/near recent lows) and sells near 247.24–249.07 (sell zone/7d resistance) were the notable levels.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Oracle was founded in 1977 and pioneered the first commercial SQL-based RDBMS, signaling long operating history. It is consistently profitable with recent net income of $12.44B and ~21% profit margin. Operating cash flow is strong at ~$21.53B, though free cash flow was negative. Overall, it appears to be a mature, stable enterprise software company rather than a fly-by-night outfit.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Oracle is actively investing in cloud infrastructure for AI training and inferencing and posted 12.2% revenue growth, indicating ongoing innovation. Headlines note very large AI cloud deals alongside scrutiny of backlog quality and margins.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Reports flag an AI-related unwind and tight liquidity across markets, with the Nasdaq 100 facing its worst November since 2008. An analyst criticized Oracle’s AI push as low-margin and questioned a large backlog, while another piece cast Oracle as a potential dark horse after a massive OpenAI cloud deal. Broader AI infrastructure supply constraints are cited as drivers of sector volatility. In this setting, chasing rumors looks risky, and reactions may skew toward skepticism rather than classic ‘sell the news’ spikes.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** No direct stock impact from tariffs is specified; available items note Oracle tools that help customers navigate tariff complexity rather than effects on ORCL shares.
