  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oklo Inc. develops advanced fission power plants using a liquid metal fast reactor, commercialized as the Aurora powerhouse product line. It pursues two tracks: selling reliable commercial-scale energy and offering used nuclear fuel recycling services in the U.S., with initial units designed to produce up to 15 MWe on recycled or fresh fuel.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—Oklo is pre-revenue with negative net income and free cash flow, so it is not yet profitable; a timeline to profitability is not disclosed in the provided data.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include AI data centers and remote facilities seeking dependable, clean power, as highlighted in recent coverage. The company targets the U.S. market for both power generation and nuclear fuel recycling services.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include NuScale Power (SMR) and other advanced nuclear/microreactor developers. Oklo is an early-stage, pre-revenue player among these peers, with no established market share yet.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down; shares retreated from a 7d high of 152.06 to 116.89, below the 20-day average and near 7d support at 116.67.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 129.67 and selling around 152.06 stood out as favorable levels per the suggested zones. The 116.67 support marked a key risk-managed entry area.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is an early-stage company rather than an established utility, with no commercial revenue and cumulative net losses of about $54.7M in the periods shown. Free cash flow (-$32.3M) and operating cash flow (-$52.1M) are negative, indicating dependence on external funding. Headlines cite DOE recognition and policy support, which provide some validation but not financial stability. Overall, its limited operating history and ongoing losses imply higher risk than a mature, cash-generating utility.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—Oklo is innovating with its Aurora liquid metal fast reactor and a dual-track model of power sales and nuclear fuel recycling. Coverage highlights potential growth serving AI data centers and remote facilities.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Headlines frame AI-driven power demand as a tailwind for advanced nuclear, with Oklo frequently cited as a beneficiary. Motley Fool pieces note the stock’s huge 2025 surge but emphasize it remains pre-revenue with uncertainty; another article flags a 30% one-week drop potentially tied to Ark Invest selling despite DOE recognition. Additional items include a $3.5B mixed-shelf filing and plans with a UK nuclear firm to invest up to $2B in fuel plants, underscoring funding needs and expansion plans. In a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news context, AI/data-center hype has produced sharp swings, and quick facts indicate ‘Buy the rumor?’ no and ‘Sell the news?’ no.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Oklo Inc. develops advanced fission power plants using a liquid metal fast reactor, commercialized as the Aurora powerhouse product line. It pursues two tracks: selling reliable commercial-scale energy and offering used nuclear fuel recycling services in the U.S., with initial units designed to produce up to 15 MWe on recycled or fresh fuel.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No—Oklo is pre-revenue with negative net income and free cash flow, so it is not yet profitable; a timeline to profitability is not disclosed in the provided data.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include AI data centers and remote facilities seeking dependable, clean power, as highlighted in recent coverage. The company targets the U.S. market for both power generation and nuclear fuel recycling services.
