  **Generated:** <time class="js-local-time" datetime="2025-11-11T05:26:27.480464+00:00">2025-11-11 05:26 UTC</time> (runtime 2m 52s)
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oklo Inc. develops advanced fission power plants to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale in the United States. It also commercializes nuclear fuel recycling technology that converts nuclear waste into usable fuel and has a joint agreement with newcleo to build advanced fuel fabrication and manufacturing infrastructure in the U.S.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is currently unprofitable, with repeated net losses and a zero profit margin alongside negative free (-$32.3M) and operating (-$52.1M) cash flow; no timeline to profitability is disclosed.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are in the United States seeking clean, reliable energy, per the company's focus. It operates in the U.S. power market as a Utilities - Independent Power Producers business, with U.S.-based fuel fabrication/manufacturing efforts via its newcleo agreement.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors and relative positioning are not provided in the supplied data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with the price below its 20-day average (136.25) and off the recent local high of 123.44 to a close of 111.52.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** A buy zone was near support around 97.06, while strength toward 123.44 offered a reasonable area to sell or take profits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is an early-stage U.S. energy company developing advanced nuclear power and fuel recycling, indicating a development-phase profile rather than a long-established utility. Financials show recurring net losses and negative free and operating cash flow, which raises balance-sheet risk typical of companies still building out operations. It has industry ties via a joint agreement with newcleo to develop U.S. fuel fabrication/manufacturing infrastructure. Detailed debt and liquidity figures are not provided, so overall balance-sheet strength cannot be fully assessed.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It appears to be innovating, with advanced fission reactor development and nuclear fuel recycling technology, plus a partnership with newcleo to expand fuel fabrication capabilities in the U.S.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Headlines flag Oklo earnings slated for Nov. 11 and note the stock surged to a 52-week high in October before pulling back since. Broader context includes valuation worries and the record-long U.S. government shutdown, while tech names were cited as big winners and a peer SMR company (NuScale) reported a wider loss. Given this setup, the quick facts indicate 'no' for both buy-the-rumor and sell-the-news, suggesting no clear rumor/news trade signal. The upcoming earnings may be the catalyst that tests sentiment after the recent slide.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Oklo Inc. develops advanced fission power plants to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale in the United States. It also commercializes nuclear fuel recycling technology that converts nuclear waste into usable fuel and has a joint agreement with newcleo to build advanced fuel fabrication and manufacturing infrastructure in the U.S.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is currently unprofitable, with repeated net losses and a zero profit margin alongside negative free (-$32.3M) and operating (-$52.1M) cash flow; no timeline to profitability is disclosed.

1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors and relative positioning are not provided in the supplied data.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with the price below its 20-day average (136.25) and off the recent local high of 123.44 to a close of 111.52.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** A buy zone was near support around 97.06, while strength toward 123.44 offered a reasonable area to sell or take profits.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is an early-stage U.S. energy company developing advanced nuclear power and fuel recycling, indicating a development-phase profile rather than a long-established utility. Financials show recurring net losses and negative free and operating cash flow, which raises balance-sheet risk typical of companies still building out operations.
