  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oklo Inc. develops advanced fission power plants, commercializing its Aurora liquid metal fast reactor product line. It plans to sell reliable, commercial-scale electricity and heat and to offer used nuclear fuel recycling services in the U.S. The first Aurora unit is designed to deliver up to 15 MWe using recycled or fresh fuel.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—Oklo is pre-revenue with recurring net losses (net income sum about -$54.7M) and negative operating (-$52.1M) and free cash flow (-$32.3M); timing to profitability is unknown.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include enterprises needing dedicated, reliable power such as AI/data centers and remote facilities, plus U.S. customers for nuclear fuel recycling services. The company targets the United States, providing heat and electricity directly to customers in both regulated and deregulated markets.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Oklo competes with advanced nuclear developers such as NuScale Power (SMR) in SMR/microreactor markets. It is an early-stage, pre-revenue player among these peers, with no specified market ranking.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down—shares are below the 20-day average and fell from a 7d local high of 123.44 to 112.65, near the 7d low at 111.79.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 111.79 or the deeper support around 97.06 looked favorable, while selling into bounces toward 123.44 or the 145.30 resistance was prudent.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is a start-up nuclear developer rather than a long-established utility. It is pre-revenue with negative operating cash flow (-$52.1M) and free cash flow (-$32.3M), implying reliance on external financing. The company filed a $3.5B mixed securities shelf, underscoring capital needs. Shares have been highly volatile, including a reported 30% weekly drop and an ATR near 13.6%, indicating elevated risk versus stable institutions.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing—Oklo is advancing the Aurora liquid-metal fast reactor and fuel recycling offerings, drawing interest tied to AI/data-center power demand. It has received DOE recognition and NRC acceptance to review a design topical report on an accelerated timeline.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage ties Oklo to the AI power crunch and the rising profile of SMRs, while noting the stock’s massive 2025 surge despite being pre-revenue and unproven commercially. Articles highlight extreme volatility, including a 30% weekly drop potentially linked to selling by a large holder, and options activity around moves. Oklo also filed a $3.5B mixed shelf and shares fell ahead of Q3, while an NRC topical report was accepted for accelerated review. Overall, hype around AI/data-center demand has buoyed sentiment, but funding actions and sell programs have triggered pullbacks—consistent with buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news dynamics, even as quick-fact flags show no current signal.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
