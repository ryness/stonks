  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — at 105.45 the stock sits below the 20-DMA 117.36 and EMA 115.20 in a 7d downtrend, between support 92.63 and resistance 116.98; macro froth is evident with the VanEck Uranium & Nuclear ETF up 71.7% in 2025 and OKLO’s own ninefold surge then ~40% pullback, making entries high-risk.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oklo develops advanced fission power plants using a liquid metal fast reactor, commercialized as the Aurora powerhouse product line. It aims to provide clean, reliable electricity (up to 15 MWe) and to sell used nuclear fuel recycling services in the U.S. Aurora can run on recycled or fresh fuel.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — net income and operating cash flow are negative with a 0.0% profit margin, and coverage notes no current revenue and profitability not expected until 2030.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include commercial buyers of reliable power such as AI data centers, along with U.S. customers for used nuclear fuel recycling services. Its markets are centered on U.S. clean power generation and nuclear fuel recycling.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include NuScale Power (SMR) among advanced reactor developers, while comparisons also cite Cameco as an established nuclear sector player; Oklo is positioned as a more speculative, earlier-stage developer relative to these peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — 7d Trend: down and price retreated from the 116.98 local high toward 105.45.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 92.63 support and selling near 116.98 resistance were favorable levels, matching the suggested buy/sell zones.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is an early-stage advanced nuclear company with no current revenue and cumulative net losses of about $74.5M and negative operating cash flow (-$62.2M). Its business is pre-commercial, indicating higher execution and financing risk. Recent trading shows high volatility (ATR ~10.8% of price) and low recent volume, underscoring stock instability. Overall, it appears more speculative than a mature, stable utility.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Oklo is innovating with its liquid metal fast reactor (Aurora) and a used-fuel recycling offering; industry coverage notes a 93% jump in its microreactor project pipeline ahead of planned deployments, signaling growth momentum.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a ninefold surge in OKLO shares followed by about a 40% decline, with no current revenue and profitability not expected until 2030. Sector context is buoyant, as the VanEck Uranium & Nuclear ETF is up 71.7% in 2025, while peer NuScale fell after lowered targets and project delays. Another piece contrasts Cameco’s established strength with Oklo’s speculative status. In this environment, rumor-driven pops can fade, and quick facts indicate 'Buy the rumor?' and 'Sell the news?' are both 'no.'
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Some reports tie tariff headlines to a 12.8% two-day drop in OKLO, suggesting sensitivity to perceived fuel/input costs; otherwise, direct, durable impacts are unclear in the provided data.
