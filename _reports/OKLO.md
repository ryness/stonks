  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oklo Inc. is developing advanced fission power plants using liquid metal fast reactor technology under its Aurora powerhouse product line. It pursues two businesses: delivering reliable, commercial-scale energy to customers and selling used nuclear fuel recycling services in the U.S., with the first Aurora designed to produce up to 15 MWe on recycled or fresh fuel.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company is pre-revenue with consecutive net losses (aggregate −$74.5M) and negative operating/free cash flow, and it targets first commercial deployment around 2027 before any path to profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include organizations needing reliable on-site power such as AI/data centers and remote or industrial users. Its markets focus on U.S. commercial power buyers and the U.S. market for nuclear fuel recycling services.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Principal competitor is NuScale Power (SMR) in advanced/small modular reactors. Oklo ranks as earlier-stage and more speculative relative to peers with established projects, per recent coverage.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares fell to 101.64 from a 109.45 open, sit below the SMA/EMA, and the period is labeled a downtrend.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near ~103.64 or stronger support around ~97.06 were favorable; sells into ~116.98 up to ~123.44 offered better exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is an early-stage company rather than a long-established utility, with recurring net losses and negative operating/free cash flow indicating funding needs. It has no reported revenue and depends on regulatory milestones and capital to build its first units. The U.S. Department of Energy’s approval of its Nuclear Safety Design Agreement for the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility adds credibility to execution. Overall stability is modest and tied to successful licensing, fabrication, and financing.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — commercializing a liquid metal fast reactor (Aurora) and pursuing fuel recycling, with recent DOE approvals and strategic milestones despite current losses.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage frames Oklo as a speculative nuclear play versus established peers, with a pre-revenue profile and a 2027 deployment target. Nuclear stocks saw sell-offs amid broader AI-related market corrections, yet Oklo rallied on regulatory progress despite a wider-than-expected loss. DOE greenlit its Aurora fuel plan, enabling fuel production and potentially expediting licensing. In the ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ context, the mix of sector profit-taking and pops on approvals suggests mixed signals rather than a clean pattern.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Some coverage links tariff headlines to short-term weakness in Oklo’s stock (e.g., an article citing a ~12.8% drop over April 3–4 tied to tariff concerns), but the company has not provided specific impact guidance.

It pursues two businesses: delivering reliable, commercial-scale energy to customers and selling used nuclear fuel recycling services in the U.S., with the first Aurora designed to produce up to 15 MWe on recycled or fresh fuel.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company is pre-revenue with consecutive net losses (aggregate −$74.5M) and negative operating/free cash flow, and it targets first commercial deployment around 2027 before any path to profitability.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares fell to 101.64 from a 109.45 open, sit below the SMA/EMA, and the period is labeled a downtrend.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is an early-stage company rather than a long-established utility, with recurring net losses and negative operating/free cash flow indicating funding needs. It has no reported revenue and depends on regulatory milestones and capital to build its first units. The U.S. Department of Energy’s approval of its Nuclear Safety Design Agreement for the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility adds credibility to execution. Overall stability is modest and tied to successful licensing, fabrication, and financing.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — commercializing a liquid metal fast reactor (Aurora) and pursuing fuel recycling, with recent DOE approvals and strategic milestones despite current losses.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage frames Oklo as a speculative nuclear play versus established peers, with a pre-revenue profile and a 2027 deployment target. Nuclear stocks saw sell-offs amid broader AI-related market corrections, yet Oklo rallied on regulatory progress despite a wider-than-expected loss.

In the ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ context, the mix of sector profit-taking and pops on approvals suggests mixed signals rather than a clean pattern.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Some coverage links tariff headlines to short-term weakness in Oklo’s stock (e.g., an article citing a ~12.8% drop over April 3–4 tied to tariff concerns), but the company has not provided specific impact guidance.
