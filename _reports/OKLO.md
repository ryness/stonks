  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — price is in a 7d downtrend and trades well below the 20DMA/EMA/SMA (88.17 vs ~113–125) between support 79.01 and resistance 110.38; macro froth cues are limited in the data, while history shows 3mo near-bottom and the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Oklo Inc. is developing advanced fission power plants, centered on its Aurora liquid metal fast reactor designed to deliver up to 15 MWe using recycled or fresh nuclear fuel. It has two tracks: providing reliable, commercial-scale energy to customers and selling used nuclear fuel recycling services in the U.S.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it has no current revenue and posted losses (e.g., -$74.51M last year with negative operating and free cash flow), and coverage indicates analysts do not expect profitability until 2030.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include large power users such as AI-focused data centers and industrials like oil & gas, highlighted by its collaboration with RPower. It aims to supply electricity and heat directly to customers and provide nuclear fuel recycling services to the U.S. market.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include NuScale Power (SMR) and broader power producers such as Vistra, with Oklo positioned as an early-stage, pre-revenue contender relative to incumbents.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the trend label is downtrend and the stock closed at 88.17 after testing 7d support near 79.01.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Better buys appeared near 92.63 and the 79.01 support; sells were more favorable near 109.70 and the 110.38 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Oklo is a U.S.-based advanced nuclear developer in the Utilities sector that is still pre-revenue and early in commercialization. It reported a -$74.51M loss in 2024 with negative operating (-$62.2M) and free cash flow (-$40.5M). However, recent coverage cites about $1.2 billion in cash, providing runway to execute its plans. Trading remains risky, with high volatility (ATR ~13.8%).
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating — it is commercializing the Aurora fast reactor and nuclear fuel recycling, and it signed a binding contract with Siemens Energy to expedite procurement of the power conversion system for its first commercial plant.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage notes steep Q3 losses alongside an asserted $1.2B cash balance and a bullish long-term outlook, including predictions of significant upside. Other articles highlight extreme volatility, noting a ninefold surge followed by a ~40% decline and no expected profitability until 2030. Sector context is supportive with a uranium/nuclear ETF up 71.7% YTD, and Oklo announced a Siemens Energy contract for its Aurora powerhouse. Options flow flagged bearish activity during a drawdown. Given these mixed signals, “buy the rumor, sell the news” hasn’t been a reliable guide here per the quick facts (buy the rumor: no; sell the news: no).
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff impacts are unclear; one article tied a double-digit drop in early April to tariff-related worries about fuel costs, but overall evidence in the data is limited.
