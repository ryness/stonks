  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — trading near 3mo/1yr 'near-bottom' and just above 7d support at 23.80; macro froth visibility is limited and price sits below the 20-day average (25.37) and 7d resistance (27.10) in a downtrend
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Moderna is a commercial-stage biotechnology company developing and commercializing medicines based on messenger RNA (mRNA). Its portfolio includes an authorized COVID-19 vaccine and 35 mRNA development candidates (as of Aug 2025). Programs span infectious disease, oncology, cardiovascular disease, and rare genetic diseases.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — currently unprofitable with negative net income (sum -$3.116B), a -139.6% profit margin, and negative free and operating cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** unknown
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include Pfizer (PFE), Novavax (NVAX), CureVac (CVAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Regeneron (REGN), and CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP); Moderna is positioned as a key mRNA platform player following U.S. authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price slid from a local high 25.33 toward support 23.80 and sits below the 20-day average 25.37.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys near ~23.80 (7d support/suggested buy zone) were attractive; sells near ~25.33 (local high/suggested sell zone) or ~27.10 (7d resistance) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Moderna was founded in 2010 and went public in 2018, reflecting more than a decade of operating history. Its mRNA platform was validated with U.S. authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2020, and it lists 35 clinical-stage candidates as of August 2025. Financially, it shows sustained losses (net income sum -$3.116B, profit margin -139.6%) and negative free and operating cash flow. Without balance sheet details, stability appears pressured by ongoing cash burn despite platform credibility.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — innovation remains active with 35 mRNA development candidates across multiple therapeutic areas, though setbacks occur (e.g., the CMV program was stopped after a Phase 3 miss).
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Moderna halted its CMV vaccine program after a Phase 3 trial failed to meet efficacy endpoints (Benzinga, Oct 23, 2025). A separate piece highlighted potential long-term upside driven by its mRNA platform and cancer vaccine candidate mRNA-4157 (Motley Fool, Oct 22, 2025). The stock shows a downtrend on low volume and is near support, which aligns more with a 'buy the dip' stance than a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' setup (quick facts: Buy the dip? yes; Buy the rumor? no; Sell the news? no). Overall, recent moves seem tied to concrete trial outcomes rather than speculative spikes.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Limited direct impact is indicated; one source places MRNA among stocks to trade without tariffs concerns, and no company-specific tariff effects are detailed in the provided data.
