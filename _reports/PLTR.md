  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 5yr is near-peak and headlines flag AI bubble/froth concerns; price 176.45 is below the 20-DMA/SMA (186.62/180.05) and closer to support 164.50 than resistance 194.93
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Palantir develops analytical software platforms that integrate data and decision workflows to improve organizational efficiency. It serves commercial customers via Foundry and government clients via Gotham. The company works with entities in Western-allied nations.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with a 28.11% profit margin, positive net income over the last four periods totaling $1.10B, and $1.18B in free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Its primary customers are government agencies and defense/intelligence organizations, alongside large commercial enterprises. Markets are the United States and other Western-allied nations across industries, delivered through Gotham (government) and Foundry (commercial).
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Snowflake, C3.ai, Nvidia, Meta, and others listed. Relative positioning or rank versus these peers is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d trend is labeled down/downtrend and price made a local low at 168.91 with the close 176.45 below the 20-DMA 186.62
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 168.91–164.50 (local low to support) looked favorable; selling into 194.93 (7d resistance/local high) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2003 and public since 2020, Palantir has an extended operating history for a software firm. It shows sustained profitability (28.11% margin) with strong cash generation ($1.82B operating cash flow and $1.18B free cash flow). Net income over the last four periods totals $1.10B, indicating durable earnings. These metrics point to a relatively stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operation.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing—revenue growth of 62.8% and earnings growth of 231% indicate strong momentum, with recent coverage citing commercial strength. This supports ongoing expansion of its Foundry and Gotham platforms.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage is mixed: one article highlights Palantir as a growth stock to buy after a strong 2025 run despite a pullback, and another notes billionaire hedge funds buying shares. CEO Alex Karp defended the company’s valuation and operations at Yahoo Finance Invest, pushing back on critics. Conversely, a piece argues Meta may be a smarter AI bet than Nvidia or Palantir, signaling AI-bubble concerns. In this context, the ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ effect seems muted (quick facts also say no) as sentiment swings between enthusiasm and skepticism.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Coverage around tariff headlines suggests limited direct exposure for Palantir, with commentary noting it handled tariff news with little impact and shares even surged on an earnings day amid tariff fears. Overall, tariff effects appear limited in the provided data.
