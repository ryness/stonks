  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Palantir provides analytical software platforms that help organizations leverage data for decision-making and operational efficiency. It serves commercial clients through Foundry and government clients through Gotham, focusing on entities in Western-allied nations.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Palantir is profitable, with positive net income totaling $763.29M across recent periods, a ~22% profit margin, and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are commercial enterprises and government agencies, served via Foundry and Gotham, respectively. Its markets are concentrated in Western-allied countries, with notable momentum in the U.S. commercial segment per recent results.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Snowflake, and C3.ai (per the provided comps list). Relative market ranking is not specified in the supplied data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — price advanced from a local low near 186.78 toward 207.52 resistance, closing at 207.18 and above the 20-DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 186.78 (close to support at 182.85) looked attractive, while selling near 199.85 and into the 207.52 resistance was favorable.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** high
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2003 and public since 2020, Palantir has a long operating history serving government and commercial clients in Western-allied markets. It shows consistent profitability across recent periods and robust cash generation, with $1.27B in free cash flow and $1.73B in operating cash flow. A profit margin near 22% alongside 48% revenue growth supports operating stability. While balance sheet specifics are not provided, these metrics indicate a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operation.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Palantir is innovating and growing via its Gotham and Foundry platforms, with strong AI adoption highlighted in Q3 results and raised guidance. Revenue growth of 48% and sharp earnings growth further indicate momentum.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines note Palantir’s Q3 beat on revenue and EPS, driven by a booming U.S. commercial business and a guidance raise. The CEO highlighted continued AI adoption, which some view as supportive for broader AI demand (e.g., Nvidia). Contrastingly, Michael Burry disclosed 5 million puts on Palantir, flagging bearish positioning and AI bubble concerns. Broader market tone is risk-on amid AI momentum and a US‑China trade truce. Given the beats and guidance raise, the quick facts’ “sell the news: yes” suggests some gains may have been priced in.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
