  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Palantir develops data analytics infrastructure software that helps organizations integrate, analyze, and act on their data. It serves commercial clients via Foundry and government customers via Gotham. The company focuses on entities in Western‑allied nations.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — Palantir is profitable, with a 28.11% profit margin, about $1.10B in cumulative net income over recent periods, and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are government agencies and commercial enterprises that need advanced data analytics and decision support. Markets are concentrated in the U.S. and Western‑allied countries, with notable strength in U.S. commercial, which grew 120% year over year per recent coverage.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Snowflake, and C3.ai. Palantir is well established in government/defense analytics and is often characterized as a leader in defense AI.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price retreated from the 207.52 resistance, set a local high at 194.93, and remains above 168.91 support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Good buy entries appeared near 168.91; logical sells were around 194.93. These align with the suggested buy/sell zones for the period.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2003 and public since 2020, Palantir has a two‑decade operating history. It is profitable with positive net income and robust cash generation (operating cash flow ~$1.82B and free cash flow ~$1.18B). Its diversified base across government and commercial segments adds resilience. Overall, the company appears financially and operationally stable based on the provided metrics.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — revenue grew ~63% year over year and earnings grew ~231%, with U.S. commercial up 120% according to recent coverage. Partnerships and new platform uses also point to active expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent articles highlight a 205% one‑year stock gain, supported by 63% YoY revenue growth and 120% U.S. commercial growth. Another piece posits Palantir as a potential future peer to Tesla’s market cap, while a separate article discusses an 11% pullback and whether it’s a buy‑the‑dip opportunity. Broader market notes cite beaten‑down large‑cap techs with upside after volatility. This mix suggests enthusiasm tempered by profit‑taking; consistent with quick facts, there is no clear ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ setup flagged.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Several articles suggest tariffs have had limited direct impact on Palantir, with some arguing tariff news could even catalyze demand; the stock has shown resilience during tariff‑related market moves. No direct operational tariff exposure is cited in the provided data.
