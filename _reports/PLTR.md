  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Palantir builds analytical software that enables organizations to integrate, analyze, and act on data. It delivers two core platforms: Gotham for government and defense, and Foundry for commercial enterprises, along with deployment and customer success services. The company focuses on clients in Western-allied nations.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes—Palantir is profitable, with $763.29M cumulative recent net income, a 28.11% profit margin, and strong free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are government and defense agencies via Gotham and enterprises across industries via Foundry. Markets are the U.S. and other Western-allied countries, operating through Government and Commercial segments.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet/Google, Snowflake, and C3.ai in AI, cloud, and analytics. Palantir is positioned as a specialized government-and-enterprise analytics platform rather than a general-purpose cloud, with no explicit market rank provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down - fell from a ~191 local high toward 178, closed below the 20-DMA (~185.4) and nearer 169 support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buy near ~186.78 (local low) or closer to 168.91 support; sell into ~191.09 (local high) or the 207.52 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2003 and public since 2020, Palantir has an established operating history with government and commercial clients. It generated $1.82B in operating cash flow and $1.18B in free cash flow, alongside multiple quarters of positive net income. With a 28.11% profit margin and ongoing profitability, it appears financially durable, though specific balance sheet details are not provided.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, evidenced by 62.8% revenue growth and 231% earnings growth. Recent AI collaborations include an Nvidia integration and a Stagwell AI marketing platform.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Coverage highlights record Q3 results with about 63% year-over-year revenue growth, yet shares pulled back on valuation concerns. Palantir announced partnerships including integrating its platform with Nvidia GPUs and an AI marketing platform with Stagwell. Other headlines note AI-led market volatility and broader tech selloffs that weighed on PLTR. This pattern hints at some sell-the-news behavior after strong prints, though the supplied indicators here do not flag a clear buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news edge.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** No direct, quantifiable tariff impact is documented; commentary suggests limited direct exposure and at times a view that tariffs could be neutral-to-supportive for PLTR, but evidence is anecdotal.
