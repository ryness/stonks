  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Palantir builds data analytics and AI software that helps organizations improve operational efficiency. It sells two core platforms: Gotham for government and defense and Foundry for commercial enterprises. The company focuses on customers in Western‑allied nations.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with a 22.19% profit margin, positive trailing net income of $763.29M, and strong free cash flow of about $1.27B.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are government agencies and commercial enterprises. Markets are concentrated in the United States and other Western‑allied nations, spanning both public sector and private industry use cases.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), Alphabet/Google, Snowflake, and C3.ai. Palantir positions as a specialized data/AI platform alongside these larger cloud and software peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — shares climbed from the ~186.78 local low toward a 207.18 close and are testing 207.52 resistance, trading above the 20‑DMA (~185).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 186.78 support looked favorable, with selling into 199.85 and up to the 207.52 resistance zone.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2003 and public since 2020, Palantir has a long operating history relative to newer tech entrants. It has delivered consecutive positive net income in recent quarters and a 22% profit margin. Operating cash flow of ~$1.73B and free cash flow of ~$1.27B indicate solid cash generation. Serving both government and commercial clients in Western‑allied markets adds to overall durability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing, with 48% revenue growth and 143.6% earnings growth, reflecting strong adoption of its AI-driven Gotham and Foundry platforms.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight AI momentum and a US‑China trade truce lifting risk appetite, with Palantir on watch ahead of earnings. Coverage also notes speculation about a potential stock split and flags valuation caution. Palantir is featured as a stock to buy and among November tech picks benefiting from AI tailwinds. Given the backdrop and quick facts indicating “sell the news,” enthusiasm into events could risk post‑news pullbacks.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Limited direct evidence; a US‑China trade truce has supported broader risk appetite, but specific tariff effects on PLTR are unknown.
