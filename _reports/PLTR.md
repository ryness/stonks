  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — history signals it’s ‘in the middle’ on 1yr/5yr per quick facts; AI macro froth risk is present in headlines (e.g., Thiel exiting NVDA, bubble chatter) despite strong NVDA prints; price is in a 7d downtrend below the 20-day SMA/EMA (165.42 vs 180.85/178.07) and sitting just above support 162.42 and well below resistance 192.93.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Palantir builds analytical software that helps organizations leverage data to improve operations. It serves commercial customers via Foundry and government clients via Gotham. The company focuses on working with entities in Western‑allied nations.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — it is profitable with a 28.11% profit margin, four straight positive quarters totaling $1.10B+ in net income, and $1.18B in free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are government agencies and commercial enterprises using its Gotham and Foundry platforms. Markets are concentrated in Western‑allied nations, with the company based in the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Snowflake, C3.ai, Nvidia, Meta, and others listed. Palantir competes as a specialized software‑infrastructure analytics platform across government and commercial segments; explicit market share ranking is not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price closed at 165.42 with a ‘downtrend’ label and is near 7d support 162.42, below 7d resistance 192.93.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Good buys occurred near the suggested buy zone 164.5 or the 7d support at 162.42. Sells were optimal into the 192.93–194.93 resistance zone.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2003 and public since 2020, Palantir has a long operating history. It shows solid fundamentals with a 28.11% profit margin and four consecutive profitable quarters totaling $1.095B in net income. Cash generation is strong, with $1.82B in operating cash flow and $1.18B in free cash flow. Serving both government and commercial clients in Western‑aligned markets adds durability, indicating a generally stable institution.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, evidenced by 62.8% revenue growth and 231.4% earnings growth in the provided period. Last Q4 revenue was $1.10B.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines spotlight AI sentiment: Peter Thiel exited a $100M NVDA stake and Burry’s anti‑AI stance revived bubble worries, while Nvidia’s ‘fantastic’ results and guidance countered those concerns. An NVDA earnings preview framed results as pivotal for tech sentiment. BigBear.ai’s mixed quarter underscored the sector’s dependence on government spending. Given quick facts of ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? no,’ chasing pre‑event hype appears discouraged and post‑event selling has not been the prevailing takeaway in this data.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Headlines indicate limited direct tariff impact on PLTR’s stock, with coverage noting it held ground while broader markets reacted to tariff threats. Overall, tariffs appear to have had a modest effect per the provided sources.
