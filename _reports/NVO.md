  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Novo Nordisk develops, manufactures, and markets diabetes and obesity treatments, including human and modern insulins, GLP-1 therapies, and oral antidiabetic agents. It also has a smaller biopharmaceutical segment focused on protein therapies for hemophilia and other rare disorders. The company operates primarily through Diabetes & Obesity Care and Rare Disease segments.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with a ~32.9% profit margin, strong free cash flow, and consistent positive net income, despite recent negative earnings growth.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Novo Nordisk primarily serves patients with diabetes, obesity, and certain rare diseases across global markets. It operates in the Diabetes & Obesity Care and Rare Disease segments, holding roughly one-third of the global branded diabetes treatment market.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Eli Lilly and Pfizer in GLP-1/obesity, with broader pharma peers like Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Novo Nordisk remains a market leader, holding about one-third of the global branded diabetes market.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares fell from a local high near 49.56 toward support around 45.15 and remain below the 20-DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 45.15 support looked favorable, while selling into 49.56–49.90 resistance offered better exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Novo Nordisk is a long-standing, global healthcare company with more than 90 years of history and a leading position in diabetes care. It shows strong financial stability with sustained profitability, robust operating cash flow, and healthy free cash flow. Its dominant market share in branded diabetes care further supports durability, though near-term earnings growth has softened. Overall, it appears to be a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operator.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is actively innovating and expanding in GLP-1 therapies for diabetes and obesity, supported by a visible R&D pipeline. Revenue is growing (5.1% YoY), though recent earnings growth is negative.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight the intense GLP-1 race among Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer, with the market expected to expand significantly. Novo Nordisk’s withdrawal from a $10B Metsera bid was framed as restoring investor trust through financial discipline. The company also agreed with the U.S. administration to lower prices for weight-loss treatments in exchange for reduced tariffs and expanded access, and Hims & Hers discussed potential collaboration for Wegovy injections. Quick facts indicate ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? no,’ suggesting muted payoff from trading headlines alone.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff impacts appear supportive following an agreement to lower prices in exchange for reduced tariffs and broader U.S. access, though price cuts could temper margin benefits. Management has also indicated limited concern about tariffs.
