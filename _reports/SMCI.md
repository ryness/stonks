  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Super Micro Computer designs and sells high-performance server and storage solutions, including modular blade servers, full-rack systems, networking devices, server sub-systems, and management software. Its turnkey platforms are developed and installed for AI data centers and serve cloud computing, data centers, high-performance computing, and IoT/embedded markets. The company reports one operating segment built on a modular, open-standard architecture.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it has positive net income and a ~3.8% profit margin, though recent revenue and earnings declined and margins have compressed.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include cloud providers, data center operators, HPC users, and IoT/embedded markets, with turn-key solutions for AI datacenters. More than half of revenue comes from the United States, with the balance from Europe, Asia, and other regions.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Dell and HPE in server hardware, with ecosystem overlap against Nvidia and AMD in AI infrastructure. Per CSIMarket (Q2 2025), SMCI’s share (~10.5%) trails Dell (~45%), indicating a smaller player by market share.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — it fell from the ~53.01 area toward 38.14 support and closed at 39.76, well below the 20-day average (~50.28).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 50.33 and selling around 53.01 stood out during the period; subsequent tests near 38.14 marked the key support level.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** This is a long-standing company that celebrated 30 years and is included in the S&P 500, indicating scale and institutional footing. Profitability is positive (cumulative net income and a positive profit margin), and operating cash flow is positive, though free cash flow is modest. The business operates a single, focused segment with broad product breadth in servers and AI datacenter solutions. Recent data highlight revenue and earnings declines and margin compression, which are watch items but not indicative of a fly-by-night profile.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is actively innovating and growing in AI infrastructure, including expanding NVIDIA-based platforms and turnkey AI datacenter solutions. Management raised full-year guidance to $36B on strong AI platform orders and cited a >$13B order book.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Shares dropped after Q1 FY2026 results missed on revenue and EPS, with pre-market declines reported and a broader selloff noted by multiple outlets. Investing.com reported revenue of $5.0B missing expectations but full-year guidance raised to $36B, alongside margin compression and cash flow management challenges. Management highlighted an order book exceeding $13B featuring Nvidia GPUs. In the context of “buy the rumor, sell the news,” the miss drove selling despite positive guidance, fitting a sell-the-news reaction rather than rumor-driven buying.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have been cited by the company as a short-term headwind around earnings, and coverage links tariff concerns to stock pressure. Company communications in May 2025 referenced tariff impacts as a near-term factor.
