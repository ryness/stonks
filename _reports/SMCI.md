  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — tech froth risk is elevated as October saw heavy shorting and stretched valuations in tech, and shares trade at 36.42 well below the 20-DMA/EMA (46.31/46.81) in a downtrend; while 3mo positioning is near-bottom and price sits above 33.69 support, it remains under 42.82 resistance.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Super Micro Computer provides high-performance server and storage systems, modular blade servers, workstations, full rack-scale solutions, networking devices, server sub-systems, and server management, with turnkey solutions designed for AI datacenters. It operates as a single segment focused on developing and delivering server solutions based on a modular, open-standard architecture to cloud computing, data center, high-performance computing, and IoT embedded markets.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it reports positive net income and a ~3.8% profit margin, though earnings growth is -60% and free cash flow is slightly negative.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers span cloud service providers, enterprise/data centers, high-performance computing users, and IoT/embedded deployments. More than half of revenue is generated in the United States, with the remainder from Europe, Asia, and other regions.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include server hardware providers such as Dell (DELL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), alongside broader AI/data center ecosystem players (e.g., NVDA, INTC, AMD); relative market rank is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d trend is down and price closed 36.42 below the recent local low 38.14 and under the 20-DMA/EMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked better near 33.69–38.14 (support/local lows), while 41.63–42.82 (local high/near-term resistance) offered logical sells.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** This appears to be a relatively established U.S.-based server hardware provider with a diversified revenue base (majority U.S., plus Europe/Asia/other). Profitability is positive (profit margin ~3.8% and cumulative net income of ~$792.8M across recent periods), and operating cash flow is positive. However, revenue (-15.5%) and earnings (-60.3%) are declining and free cash flow is slightly negative, indicating near-term pressure. Balance sheet details (debt/cash) are not provided in the data, limiting a full stability assessment.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and expanding, highlighted by AI datacenter turnkey solutions, expanded collaboration with NVIDIA, and the creation of Super Micro Federal LLC to target federal markets; management has also outlined an up to $11B next-quarter sales outlook and at least $36B for fiscal 2026, albeit with margin pressure noted.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage points to a 2025 comeback narrative while also noting a tough quarter with a 15% revenue decline and short-term margin pressure. Management and analysts highlight strong AI-driven demand with guidance of up to $11B in next-quarter sales and at least $36B for fiscal 2026, supported by NVIDIA-equipped systems and backlog. At the same time, tech stocks faced heavy shorting in October amid stretched valuations, signaling caution. Considering the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news adage, bullish forecasts could face skepticism given macro froth, and quick facts flag no clear buy-the-rumor or sell-the-news signals.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

![Super Micro Computer, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/SMCI.svg)


## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — tech froth risk is elevated as October saw heavy shorting and stretched valuations in tech, and shares trade at 36.42 well below the 20-DMA/EMA (46.31/46.81) in a downtrend; while 3mo positioning is near-bottom and price sits above 33.69 support, it remains under 42.82 resistance.

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Super Micro Computer provides high-performance server and storage systems, modular blade servers, workstations, full rack-scale solutions, networking devices, server sub-systems, and server management, with turnkey solutions designed for AI datacenters. It operates as a single segment focused on developing and delivering server solutions based on a modular, open-standard architecture to cloud computing, data center, high-performance computing, and IoT embedded markets.

1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it reports positive net income and a ~3.8% profit margin, though earnings growth is -60% and free cash flow is slightly negative.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers span cloud service providers, enterprise/data centers, high-performance computing users, and IoT/embedded deployments. More than half of revenue is generated in the United States, with the remainder from Europe, Asia, and other regions.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include server hardware providers such as Dell (DELL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), alongside broader AI/data center ecosystem players (e.g., NVDA, INTC, AMD); relative market rank is not specified in the provided data.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d trend is down and price closed 36.42 below the recent local low 38.14 and under the 20-DMA/EMA.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked better near 33.69–38.14 (support/local lows), while 41.63–42.82 (local high/near-term resistance) offered logical sells.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** This appears to be a relatively established U.S.-based server hardware provider with a diversified revenue base (majority U.S., plus Europe/Asia/other). Profitability is positive (profit margin ~3.8% and cumulative net income of ~$792.8M across recent periods), and operating cash flow is positive. However, revenue (-15.5%) and earnings (-60.3%) are declining and free cash flow is slightly negative, indicating near-term pressure. Balance sheet details (debt/cash) are not provided in the data, limiting a full stability assessment.

3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and expanding, highlighted by AI datacenter turnkey solutions, expanded collaboration with NVIDIA, and the creation of Super Micro Federal LLC to target federal markets; management has also outlined an up to $11B next-quarter sales outlook and at least $36B for fiscal 2026, albeit with margin pressure noted.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage points to a 2025 comeback narrative while also noting a tough quarter with a 15% revenue decline and short-term margin pressure. Management and analysts highlight strong AI-driven demand with guidance of up to $11B in next-quarter sales and at least $36B for fiscal 2026, supported by NVIDIA-equipped systems and backlog. At the same time, tech stocks faced heavy shorting in October amid stretched valuations, signaling caution. Considering the buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news adage, bullish forecasts could face skepticism given macro froth, and quick facts flag no clear buy-the-rumor or sell-the-news signals.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
