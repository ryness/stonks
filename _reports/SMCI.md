  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 3mo positioning at 'bottom' with price near 7d/30d support (33.20) offers a potential entry; sector froth is elevated per October shorting/valuation headlines and shares sit well below the 20D/EMA/SMA (43.34/45.86/47.71) in a downtrend
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Super Micro Computer provides high-performance server, storage, and networking solutions, including modular blade servers, rack-scale systems, workstations, server sub-systems, and management software. It designs, develops, validates, and installs turnkey systems for AI data centers and HPC under a single operating segment built on a modular, open-standard architecture. More than half of revenue comes from the United States, with the rest from Europe, Asia, and other regions.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — the firm shows positive net income and a 3.77% profit margin, though earnings growth is down (-60.3%) and recent free cash flow is slightly negative.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprise data centers, cloud providers, AI/HPC operators, and embedded/edge/IoT users. It sells mainly in the U.S. (majority of revenue) with additional sales in Europe, Asia, and other regions, and is expanding into U.S. federal markets via a new federal entity.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Dell and HPE in servers (plus ecosystem players like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel); CSIMarket shows SMCI around 10.5% share versus Dell near 45%, placing SMCI behind larger incumbents.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — pressing 7d support near 33.20 and below 7d resistance 39.99 amid a downtrend label
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 33.20 (7d/30d support) or the suggested 38.14 buy zone looked favorable; selling into 39.99–41.63 (7d resistance/suggested sell zone) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Super Micro Computer is an established vendor (its site notes 30 years of innovation) and joined the S&P 500 in 2024, signaling scale and institutional acceptance. It is currently profitable (net income sum $792.81M; profit margin 3.77%) with positive operating cash flow ($333.1M), though free cash flow is slightly negative. Recent revenue and earnings growth are down (-15.5% and -60.3%), indicating some cyclicality. Overall, it appears more stable than a fly-by-night operation, albeit exposed to industry swings.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — recent releases highlight expanded AI-optimized systems and collaborations (e.g., NVIDIA Blackwell platforms), new cloud-provider solutions, and showcasing next-gen HPC/AI infrastructure. The creation of a U.S. federal entity underscores targeted market expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Sector sentiment is tethered to Nvidia’s imminent earnings, which could swing broader AI/hardware names. SMCI has been cited among 2025 comeback stocks and appeared on oversold watchlists, while October headlines flagged high tech shorting amid stretched valuations. Company updates spotlight new AI/HPC offerings and federal-market expansion, and collaborations with NVIDIA/Intel/Micron. Given “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no” in the quick facts, recent flows may not follow the classic adage, especially with macro-led moves around NVDA. Net effect: catalysts exist, but positioning and sentiment remain delicate.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have been a headwind, with management referencing tariff impacts and the stock seeing sharp drops around tariff headlines and policy signals in 2025.

![Super Micro Computer, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/SMCI.svg)


## 0. Entry Radar

0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 3mo positioning at 'bottom' with price near 7d/30d support (33.20) offers a potential entry; sector froth is elevated per October shorting/valuation headlines and shares sit well below the 20D/EMA/SMA (43.34/45.86/47.71) in a downtrend

## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Super Micro Computer provides high-performance server, storage, and networking solutions, including modular blade servers, rack-scale systems, workstations, server sub-systems, and management software. It designs, develops, validates, and installs turnkey systems for AI data centers and HPC under a single operating segment built on a modular, open-standard architecture. More than half of revenue comes from the United States, with the rest from Europe, Asia, and other regions.

1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — the firm shows positive net income and a 3.77% profit margin, though earnings growth is down (-60.3%) and recent free cash flow is slightly negative.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprise data centers, cloud providers, AI/HPC operators, and embedded/edge/IoT users. It sells mainly in the U.S. (majority of revenue) with additional sales in Europe, Asia, and other regions, and is expanding into U.S. federal markets via a new federal entity.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Dell and HPE in servers (plus ecosystem players like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel); CSIMarket shows SMCI around 10.5% share versus Dell near 45%, placing SMCI behind larger incumbents.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — pressing 7d support near 33.20 and below 7d resistance 39.99 amid a downtrend label

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 33.20 (7d/30d support) or the suggested 38.14 buy zone looked favorable; selling into 39.99–41.63 (7d resistance/suggested sell zone) offered exits.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Super Micro Computer is an established vendor (its site notes 30 years of innovation) and joined the S&P 500 in 2024, signaling scale and institutional acceptance. It is currently profitable (net income sum $792.81M; profit margin 3.77%) with positive operating cash flow ($333.1M), though free cash flow is slightly negative. Recent revenue and earnings growth are down (-15.5% and -60.3%), indicating some cyclicality. Overall, it appears more stable than a fly-by-night operation, albeit exposed to industry swings.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — recent releases highlight expanded AI-optimized systems and collaborations (e.g., NVIDIA Blackwell platforms), new cloud-provider solutions, and showcasing next-gen HPC/AI infrastructure. The creation of a U.S. federal entity underscores targeted market expansion.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Sector sentiment is tethered to Nvidia’s imminent earnings, which could swing broader AI/hardware names. SMCI has been cited among 2025 comeback stocks and appeared on oversold watchlists, while October headlines flagged high tech shorting amid stretched valuations. Company updates spotlight new AI/HPC offerings and federal-market expansion, and collaborations with NVIDIA/Intel/Micron. Given “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no” in the quick facts, recent flows may not follow the classic adage, especially with macro-led moves around NVDA. Net effect: catalysts exist, but positioning and sentiment remain delicate.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariffs have been a headwind, with management referencing tariff impacts and the stock seeing sharp drops around tariff headlines and policy signals in 2025.
