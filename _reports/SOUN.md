  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent conversational Voice AI platform that enables high-quality, multilingual interactions for businesses. Its AI-driven products include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, serving product creators and service providers across retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company is not profitable, with a negative profit margin and cumulative net losses (-$225.1M) alongside negative operating and free cash flow; recent coverage also cites cash burn and an uncertain path to profitability despite rapid revenue growth.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and product creators in retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants that need voice AI capabilities. The company is U.S.-based and deploys its platform across these industry markets and embedded devices/services.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include large AI and automotive technology ecosystems such as Nvidia and Stellantis. SoundHound is a smaller, independent player versus these giants, not a market leader.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, as price retreated from the local high near 19.09 to a 17.11 close and tested support around 16.42.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 16.56–16.42 (suggested buy zone/support) looked attractive, while selling near 19.09 (local high/resistance) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI is a U.S.-based technology company with a multi-industry Voice AI platform and a growing product suite. Its stability is challenged by cumulative net losses (-$225.1M), a deeply negative profit margin, and negative operating cash flow, indicating ongoing cash burn. Recent commentary also notes stock dilution and an uncertain path to profitability. High recent volatility further points to elevated risk despite strong revenue growth.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—innovation and growth are evident, with Q2 revenue tripling year over year to $42.7M and product expansions like Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents. Some coverage also cites ambitions for sustained growth across financial and healthcare markets.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a sharp pullback (down nearly 30%) even as the company pivots toward voice-first agentic AI via the Amelia acquisition. The latest earnings write-up notes revenue tripling to $42.7M but flags cash burn, dilution, and an uncertain path to profitability, leading to a hold stance. Other pieces are bullish on long-term potential, citing a 217% quarterly revenue increase, a 143% six-month stock run, and growth plans across financial and healthcare, while acknowledging potential challenges. Given this mix, rallies on optimistic narratives may fade on hard numbers; quick facts show Buy the rumor? no and Sell the news? no, suggesting the adage isn’t the primary driver.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

![SoundHound AI, Inc. Class A Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/SOUN.png)


## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent conversational Voice AI platform that enables high-quality, multilingual interactions for businesses. Its AI-driven products include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, serving product creators and service providers across retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company is not profitable, with a negative profit margin and cumulative net losses (-$225.1M) alongside negative operating and free cash flow; recent coverage also cites cash burn and an uncertain path to profitability despite rapid revenue growth.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and product creators in retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants that need voice AI capabilities. The company is U.S.-based and deploys its platform across these industry markets and embedded devices/services.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include large AI and automotive technology ecosystems such as Nvidia and Stellantis. SoundHound is a smaller, independent player versus these giants, not a market leader.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, as price retreated from the local high near 19.09 to a 17.11 close and tested support around 16.42.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 16.56–16.42 (suggested buy zone/support) looked attractive, while selling near 19.09 (local high/resistance) offered exits.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI is a U.S.-based technology company with a multi-industry Voice AI platform and a growing product suite. Its stability is challenged by cumulative net losses (-$225.1M), a deeply negative profit margin, and negative operating cash flow, indicating ongoing cash burn. Recent commentary also notes stock dilution and an uncertain path to profitability. High recent volatility further points to elevated risk despite strong revenue growth.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—innovation and growth are evident, with Q2 revenue tripling year over year to $42.7M and product expansions like Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents. Some coverage also cites ambitions for sustained growth across financial and healthcare markets.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a sharp pullback (down nearly 30%) even as the company pivots toward voice-first agentic AI via the Amelia acquisition. The latest earnings write-up notes revenue tripling to $42.7M but flags cash burn, dilution, and an uncertain path to profitability, leading to a hold stance. Other pieces are bullish on long-term potential, citing a 217% quarterly revenue increase, a 143% six-month stock run, and growth plans across financial and healthcare, while acknowledging potential challenges. Given this mix, rallies on optimistic narratives may fade on hard numbers; quick facts show Buy the rumor? no and Sell the news? no, suggesting the adage isn’t the primary driver.
