  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent voice and conversational AI platform that enables high-quality, multilingual interactions for businesses. Its products include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, serving use cases across automotive, restaurants, smart devices, retail, financial services, and healthcare.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with a profit margin of -171% and cumulative net income of -$225.14M, plus negative operating and free cash flow. Recent coverage also cites ongoing cash burn and no current profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are product creators and service providers in automotive, restaurants, smart devices, retail, financial services, and healthcare that deploy voice AI. Markets served span these industry verticals, with the company based in the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Listed competitor and related-company data identify NVIDIA (NVDA) and Stellantis (STLA) as principal peers. The dataset does not provide market share or ranking, so relative positioning is unspecified.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with price retreating from a local high of 19.09 toward support near 16.42 and sitting below the 20-day average (18.57).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 16.56-16.42 (suggested buy zone/support) offered favorable entries. Selling into strength around 19.09 (resistance/suggested sell zone) looked prudent.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI is a U.S.-listed software company focused on voice AI. Financially it remains higher risk, with a -$225.14M cumulative net loss, -171% profit margin, and negative operating and free cash flow. Trading characteristics show high volatility (ATR ~7.9% of price) on medium volume. Strong revenue growth (about 217%) helps the outlook, but near-term stability depends on reducing cash burn.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, expanding its voice-first agentic AI through products like Smart Answering/Ordering and the Amelia AI Agents, and posting triple-digit revenue growth. However, it is still working toward sustainable profitability.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight a sharp pullback (down nearly 30%) even as SoundHound reported Q2 revenue of $42.7M, up 217% year over year, with articles citing cash burn, dilution, and a 'hold' stance. Other pieces emphasize its transition to voice-first agentic AI following the Amelia acquisition and potential long-term upside. While growth narratives are strong, the mixed reaction and drawdown suggest enthusiasm may have been tempered post-results. The quick facts indicate no clear 'buy the rumor' or 'sell the news' signal in this period.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
