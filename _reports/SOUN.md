  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent voice AI platform that powers conversational experiences across numerous languages. Its products include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, serving product creators and service providers across retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No; it remains unprofitable with a -171% profit margin, negative operating cash flow, and negative free cash flow, and recent coverage highlights ongoing cash burn and an uncertain path to profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and product creators in retail, financial services (including an Apivia Courtage partnership), healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants that embed voice AI into customer interactions. The U.S.-based company serves these industries with multilingual conversational solutions.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Listed competitor candidates are NVIDIA and Stellantis; SoundHound is a smaller, specialized voice-AI provider relative to these large incumbents.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down; fell from the 17.85 local high toward 15.10 support and sits below the 20-DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 15.10 support looked attractive, while selling into 17.85 and the 19.09 resistance offered favorable exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI is a U.S.-listed technology company with an established voice AI platform and multiple products deployed across industries. Financials show cumulative net losses of $225.14M, a -171% profit margin, and negative operating and free cash flow, signaling balance-sheet pressure and funding reliance. While revenue growth is strong (217% YoY), profitability has not been reached. Overall, it is more an emerging growth name than a fully stable institution.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, evidenced by new products (e.g., Dynamic Drive-Thru, Smart Answering) and the Amelia acquisition, alongside a 217% quarterly revenue increase reported in recent coverage.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a sharp pullback (“Down Nearly 30%, Should You Buy the Dip?”) alongside strong Q2 revenue growth that tripled to $42.7M but with ongoing cash burn and dilution concerns. Other pieces cite a 217% quarterly revenue increase and a 143% six-month stock surge, while cautioning about potential 2026 challenges. Articles frame the company’s transition to a comprehensive voice AI platform with potential upside by 2026. Given the mix of hype and subsequent drawdowns, the data suggest “buy the dip” has been more relevant than “buy the rumor, sell the news,” aligning with quick facts indicating no clear benefit from rumor or news timing.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have coincided with downside in the stock, with one report noting a selloff that was accelerated by tariff news but began beforehand; the sustained impact on SOUN remains unclear.
