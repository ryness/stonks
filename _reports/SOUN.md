  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — at a 3mo 'bottom' per quick facts with no clear macro froth cues in the data; price is just above 7d/30d support 10.97 but below the 20DMA/EMA (~15.06/15.46) and facing 7d resistance 14.30 and a local high 14.98
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent Voice AI platform that powers high-quality conversational experiences for businesses. Its offerings include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, addressing use cases across retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — profit margin is deeply negative and cumulative net income and cash flows are in the red; while guidance was raised and described as on a trajectory toward profitability, timing is not confirmed in the provided data.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are product creators and service providers across retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants. Based in the United States, it serves these markets with support for numerous languages; broader geographic reach is not specified.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors noted include large AI and automotive players such as NVIDIA (NVDA) and Stellantis (STLA); relative market ranking is not specified in the data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — fell from a local high near 14.98 to 11.56 and sits below the 20DMA 15.06 in a labeled downtrend
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 10.97 looked favorable; selling into 14.30–14.98 (7d resistance/local high) offered better exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI appears to be a real operating platform company with multiple products (Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, Amelia AI Agents) serving several industries. Financially, cumulative net income over the provided periods is -$312.66M with a deeply negative profit margin and negative operating and free cash flow. Volatility is elevated (ATR ~9.2% of price) and the stock is in a recent downtrend. Overall, it is not a fly-by-night, but financial stability is challenged by ongoing losses and cash burn.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes—revenue growth of 67.6% and a raised 2025 outlook, alongside an expanding voice/AI agent product set, indicate active innovation and growth.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlighted raised guidance and “record-breaking growth,” alongside an article predicting a rebound next year and another noting partnerships with brands like Stellantis and Mercedes amid cash burn concerns. There was also a piece listing oversold stocks to watch, suggesting sentiment-driven opportunities after a downturn. Despite upbeat narratives, the 7d Trend is down and quick facts flag “Buy the rumor? no” and “Sell the news? no,” implying limited immediate payoff from chasing headlines. Taken together, enthusiasm exists, but the adage offers little clear edge here given the current downtrend.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
