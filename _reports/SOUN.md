  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** no — in a 7d downtrend, shares closed 12.17 well below the 20-DMA 16.09/EMA 15.79/SMA 16.64 and under 7d resistance 15.68 while sitting just above support 11.55; macro froth visibility is limited in the supplied data, and 3mo positioning is 'near-bottom' rather than extended.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent voice and conversational AI platform enabling natural, multi-language interactions. Its products include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents for enterprises and device makers. It serves sectors such as automotive, restaurants, retail, financial services, healthcare, and smart devices.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable with a -210.7% profit margin and negative free and operating cash flow, though it recently raised its 2025 outlook indicating a trajectory toward profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are product creators and service providers across automotive, restaurants, retail, financial services, healthcare, and smart devices. Markets include the United States, Korea, France, Japan, and Germany, with partnerships noted with Stellantis and Mercedes.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors noted in the dataset include NVIDIA and Stellantis; SoundHound is a niche voice-AI provider among larger players, with no explicit market rank provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the stock closed at 12.17 below the suggested 13.72–14.98 buy/sell range and under the 20-DMA 16.09.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 13.72 (suggested buy zone) and selling near 14.98 (suggested sell zone) were favorable levels; 11.55 acted as nearby support for risk management or opportunistic entries.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI is an established voice-AI platform company but not yet a mature, cash-generative business. Its recent net income history sums to a loss (-$312.66M), profit margin is deeply negative, and both operating cash flow and free cash flow are negative, indicating balance-sheet strain. However, it shows strong revenue growth (67.6% y/y cited) and partnerships with major automakers (Stellantis, Mercedes), which add commercial validation. Overall stability is moderate-to-weak versus established tech incumbents, with execution and funding risks still present.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating and growing, integrating generative AI with speech recognition and expanding offerings like Dynamic Drive-Thru and Amelia AI Agents, with a raised outlook and rapid revenue growth noted.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights record growth and a raised 2025 outlook, suggesting momentum and a path toward profitability. Other analyses emphasize rapid revenue expansion but ongoing cash burn, dilution, and operating losses, framing the stock as speculative. The company is shifting to a voice-first agentic AI posture after acquiring Amelia and has partnerships with brands like Stellantis and Mercedes. Considering 'buy the rumor, sell the news,' the sizable drawdowns despite upbeat headlines suggest good news may have been partly priced in or outweighed by profitability concerns.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have been a headwind, with SOUN’s decline accelerating around tariff news in April 2025, though weakness preceded the announcements.
