  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — 3mo positioning is at 'bottom' with a 7d downtrend and 'Overbought/Sold?' in the middle, indicating limited macro froth cues; price is near 7d support at 10.35 and well below key averages (11.22 vs 20DMA 14.38, EMA 15.00, SMA 16.32) and under 7d resistance 13.19.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent Voice AI platform that enables businesses to deliver conversational experiences. Its products include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents. It serves sectors such as retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with a -210.68% profit margin and negative operating cash flow; recent coverage notes a raised 2025 outlook and a trajectory toward profitability but no confirmed profitability yet.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and product creators in restaurants, automotive, financial services, healthcare, retail, and smart devices seeking multilingual conversational AI. Markets are global, with customers in the United States, Korea, France, Japan, and Germany. The platform equips service providers and device makers to add voice interfaces.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include large AI and automotive ecosystem players such as Nvidia and Stellantis per the related_companies list. SoundHound competes as a niche independent voice AI platform; relative market rank is not disclosed.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — slid from a local high of 13.19 toward an 11.22 close with a local low of 10.97.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys were favorable near 10.97 and into the 10.35 support area. Sells were attractive on approaches to the 13.19 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI appears to be a functioning operating company with a multi-industry Voice AI platform rather than a fly-by-night venture. However, cumulative net losses total -$312.66M and both operating cash flow and free cash flow are negative, pointing to financial strain. The stock exhibits high volatility (ATR ~9.97% of price) and a downtrend near recent support. Longevity and detailed balance sheet strength are not provided in the supplied data.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — revenue growth is strong (about 67.6% YoY) and the company is rolling out AI-driven offerings like Dynamic Drive-Thru and Smart Ordering. Recent coverage also notes a raised 2025 outlook, suggesting ongoing expansion.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Coverage highlights rapid growth and a raised outlook (Massive News: SoundHound AI Just Raised Its Outlook) but also notes profitability challenges despite momentum (Looks Unstoppable...faces challenges with profitability). Other pieces flag oversold conditions and predict a rebound, and discuss a transition toward AI agents. This mix suggests optimism tempered by losses; quick facts state Buy the rumor? no and Sell the news? no, implying no clear rumor/news trade edge. Near term, the stock remains in a downtrend.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have acted as a headwind, with reports that tariffs accelerated SOUN’s selloff on specific days and broader market pieces linking AI weakness to tariff concerns. Net impact appears negative via added pressure and volatility.
