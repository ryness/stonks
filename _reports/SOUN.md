  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent voice and conversational AI platform that enables businesses to deliver high-quality, multilingual voice experiences. Its offerings include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, serving use cases across automotive, restaurants, retail, financial services, healthcare, and smart devices.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable with a negative profit margin (-2.11) and negative operating and free cash flow; coverage has referenced a goal of profitability around 2025, but it has not been achieved.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are product creators and service providers embedding voice AI into products and operations across automotive, restaurants, retail, financial services, healthcare, and smart devices. It serves global enterprise markets and has partnerships with major brands like Stellantis and Mercedes.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include large AI and technology players and ecosystem participants per provided lists, notably NVIDIA and Stellantis. Relative positioning versus these larger peers is not specified.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares fell from a local high near 17.85 to a 14.14 close and sit below the 20-day average (~17.87).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 13.72 looked attractive, while selling into 17.85–17.93 resistance offered good exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound AI is a publicly listed U.S. technology company focused on voice AI with growing commercial partnerships. Financially it remains loss-making: profit margin is negative (-2.11), operating cash flow (-$109M) and free cash flow are negative, and cumulative net income is a loss. Revenue growth is strong (about 67.6% year over year cited) and partnerships with Stellantis and Mercedes provide validation. Overall it is higher risk than mature, cash-generative peers.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating by combining generative AI with speech recognition and expanding products (including the Amelia acquisition for agentic AI), with rapid revenue growth indicating traction.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights rapid growth but ongoing losses: Q2 revenue reportedly tripled year over year to $42.7M with concerns about cash burn and dilution, and a Q3 deep dive noted revenue ahead of expectations with 67.6% YoY growth. Headlines also cited shares falling 11.6% ahead of Q3 earnings and a separate session where the stock outperformed in late October. Other pieces characterized the stock as speculative even after acquiring Amelia. The pre-earnings weakness followed by a revenue beat suggests the classic 'buy the rumor, sell the news' pattern did not clearly apply.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
