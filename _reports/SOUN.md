  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent conversational Voice AI platform that powers voice-enabled experiences for businesses. Its products include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, serving use cases across automotive, restaurants, smart devices, retail, financial services, and healthcare.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—SoundHound is currently unprofitable with a -171% profit margin and negative operating and free cash flow; timing to profitability is not provided.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are product creators and service providers in enterprise and device ecosystems, including automotive OEMs, restaurant operators, and enterprises across retail, financial services, and healthcare. The company serves multi-language voice AI needs across these industry markets and smart devices in the United States and beyond.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Listed competitors include Nvidia (NVDA) and Stellantis (STLA); SoundHound is a smaller, niche voice AI player relative to these much larger firms.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, as price faded from a local high near 19.09 to ~17.43 and remains below the 20-DMA (~18.58).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Pullbacks toward ~16.56 (near support) offered better buy entries, while strength into ~19.09 (resistance) looked like favorable sell/trim levels.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound is a U.S. technology company focused on enterprise voice AI, but its financial profile remains early-stage. It has cumulative net losses of $225.14M, a -171% profit margin, and negative operating (-$112.12M) and free cash flow. While revenue growth is rapid (217% y/y) and the Amelia acquisition expands capabilities, news highlights ongoing cash burn and stock dilution risks. Overall, it is more speculative than stable, despite growing multi-industry traction.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing, evidenced by agentic voice AI initiatives, the Amelia acquisition, and triple-digit revenue growth. Product expansion across automotive, restaurants, and enterprise supports continued development.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a near-30% pullback amid a shift to voice-first agentic AI after acquiring Amelia, alongside strong revenue growth but ongoing cash burn. The latest earnings commentary notes Q2 revenue tripled to $42.7M with dilution and profitability challenges, leading to a ‘hold’ stance. Other pieces tout 217% quarterly revenue growth and multi-year growth potential, while also acknowledging volatility after a 143% six-month run. In the context of ‘buy the rumor, sell the news,’ sentiment appears mixed—hype around growth and partnerships met with a subsequent drawdown and caution, and QuickRef flags ‘no’ for both buy-the-rumor and sell-the-news.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
