  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent voice and conversational AI platform that powers natural-language interactions for enterprises and product creators. Its offerings include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents serving sectors such as automotive, restaurants, smart devices, retail, financial services, and healthcare.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it remains unprofitable with negative net income (aggregate −$225.14M), a −1.71 profit margin, and negative operating cash flow; while prior commentary pointed to profitability by 2025, recent coverage still highlights cash burn and no current profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and product creators across automotive, restaurants/QSR, smart devices, retail, financial services, and healthcare. Partnerships cited include Stellantis and Mercedes, indicating deep ties in automotive alongside enterprise call answering and ordering use cases.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitor sets cited include large ecosystem players like NVIDIA and Stellantis. SoundHound is a smaller, specialized voice-AI provider relative to these larger competitors, with no clear market-leader status indicated.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the stock closed at 14.23 near 7d support, below its 20-DMA (18.03) and off a local high of 17.85.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 14.23 (support/suggested buy zone) and selling into 17.85 (resistance/suggested sell zone) offered favorable risk-reward during this window.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** While growing quickly, the company shows limited financial stability at present: cumulative net income is negative (−$225.14M) with a −1.71 profit margin and −$112M operating cash flow. News cites cash burn and dilution concerns despite strong revenue growth (e.g., Q2 revenue tripled to $42.7M). Partnerships with large brands like Stellantis and Mercedes and diversified vertical exposure add some durability, but the overall profile is still speculative rather than steady.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is actively innovating, shifting to voice-first agentic AI via the Amelia acquisition and exploring generative AI synergies. Rapid revenue growth (e.g., 217% y/y in a recent quarter) underscores momentum.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights rapid growth (Q2 revenue tripled to $42.7M; 217% quarterly growth) and new directions (agentic AI via the Amelia acquisition) alongside partnerships with Stellantis and Mercedes. However, multiple pieces flag ongoing cash burn, operating losses, and dilution, with one article calling the stock a hold and another noting a ~30% pullback. Other commentary referenced a 143% six‑month surge earlier and ambitious growth plans, but also potential challenges ahead. This mix suggests classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news dynamics: enthusiasm on growth headlines followed by selling on profitability concerns.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate tariff headlines accelerated a stock decline in early April 2025, adding pressure even as shares were already falling. Net effect: negative sentiment and incremental downside tied to tariff news.
