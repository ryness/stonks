  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent voice AI platform that powers conversational experiences for enterprises and product makers. Its offerings include Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents, serving use cases across automotive, restaurants, smart devices, retail, financial services, and healthcare.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—currently unprofitable with a -1.71 profit margin, -$112.1M operating cash flow, and cumulative net losses of about -$225.1M; headlines also note cash burn and no current profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are product creators and service providers such as automakers, restaurants, device makers, retailers, financial institutions, and healthcare organizations. Markets span these industries, delivering multilingual voice AI for customer service, ordering, and embedded/in-car experiences.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Named competitors/peers include NVDA and STLA. Relative positioning versus these companies is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, with the close (~17.34) below the 20-day MA (18.57) after failing near 19.09 resistance and drifting toward 16.56–16.42 support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buy near the 16.56–16.42 support zone; sell or trim near the 19.09 resistance level based on the recent range.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** This is a developing technology company with elevated risk rather than a mature, stable institution. It has a cumulative net loss of about $225M, a -1.71 profit margin, and negative operating cash flow (-$112M). Free cash flow is negative and recent coverage cites cash burn and stock dilution. Trading is characterized by high volatility, underscoring financial and market instability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** The company is innovating and growing, with Q2 revenue tripling year over year to $42.7M and a shift toward voice-first agentic AI via the Amelia acquisition. Growth initiatives are evident despite ongoing cash burn.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight a near-30% pullback, even as Q2 revenue tripled to $42.7M and the company pivots to agentic voice AI after acquiring Amelia. Coverage flags cash burn, dilution, and lack of current profitability, with one view rating the stock a hold. Other pieces tout strong growth potential (217% revenue increase) and prospects of sizable gains by 2026, while noting the stock had surged 143% in six months before setbacks. The mix of hype, rapid gains, and subsequent declines suggests buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news dynamics may be at play.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
