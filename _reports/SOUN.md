  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** SoundHound AI provides an independent voice AI platform that delivers conversational experiences across industries including retail, financial services, healthcare, automotive, smart devices, and restaurants. Its product suite includes Smart Answering, Smart Ordering, Dynamic Drive-Thru, and Amelia AI Agents sold to product creators and service providers.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with cumulative net losses of $225.1M, a -171% profit margin, and negative operating/free cash flow; recent coverage also cites ongoing cash burn and operating losses.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are enterprises and OEMs/product creators across automotive (e.g., partnerships with Stellantis and Mercedes), restaurants, retailers, financial services, healthcare, and smart device makers. It serves multiple industry verticals globally, with U.S.-based operations.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Listed competitors/alternatives include NVIDIA and Stellantis per MarketBeat and the provided competitor list. Relative market ranking versus these larger peers is not specified in the data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down, as price slid from a local high near 17.85 to close at 14.23 below the 20-day average and near stated 7-day support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Pullbacks near 14.23 (support/suggested buy zone ~14.225) were attractive buys, while rallies toward 17.85 (suggested sell/local high) or resistance near 18.76 offered sell opportunities.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** SoundHound is a publicly traded U.S. technology company with enterprise partnerships such as Stellantis and Mercedes, indicating commercial traction. Financially, it remains loss-making with a -$225.1M cumulative net income, -171% profit margin, and negative operating and free cash flow. Coverage highlights cash burn and stock dilution despite rapid revenue growth. Overall, it is a high-growth but financially fragile company rather than a mature, cash-generative institution.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating, combining generative AI with speech recognition and shifting to voice-first agentic AI after acquiring Amelia; it also reported Q2 revenue tripling to $42.7M year over year.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent articles note Q2 revenue tripled to $42.7M but flag cash burn, dilution, and an ongoing lack of profitability, leading to a cautious 'hold' stance. The company is pursuing generative AI and speech-recognition synergies with partnerships like Stellantis and Mercedes, and is transitioning after acquiring Amelia. Coverage highlights a prior 143% six-month surge and a subsequent near-30% pullback, framing SOUN as speculative. In the context of 'buy the rumor, sell the news,' strong partnership and growth headlines appear to have been followed by selling on profitability and dilution concerns.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
