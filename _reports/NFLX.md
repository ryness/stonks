  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Netflix operates a global subscription streaming service focused on on-demand TV series, movies, and documentaries, historically avoiding live programming and sports. It monetizes primarily through subscriptions and, since 2022, an ad-supported tier that adds advertising revenue. It has the largest TV entertainment subscriber base in the U.S. and internationally, exceeding 300 million globally.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — Netflix is profitable, with roughly a 24% profit margin, over $10.4B in recent cumulative net income, and $23.4B in free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are global consumers streaming TV and films, plus brands/advertisers buying inventory on its ad-supported plans. It serves the U.S. and nearly all international markets outside China, with over 300 million subscribers and growing engagement, including in emerging economies like India per recent coverage.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Disney (Disney+/Hulu), Amazon (Prime Video), Warner Bros. Discovery (Max), Alphabet/YouTube, Apple TV+, Comcast/Peacock, Roku, and Meta. In the U.S., Netflix is near the top with about a 21% streaming market share, second to Amazon’s ~22%.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — rose off the ~1073 local low toward 1167 resistance and closed at 1117, aligning with the stated uptrend.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked favorable near support/suggested buy around 1073–1085; sells or trims near resistance/suggested sell around 1167.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Netflix is a scaled, long-standing streaming leader with more than 300 million subscribers and reach across nearly all markets outside China. It demonstrates durable profitability (about 24% margin) and strong cash generation ($23.4B free cash flow and $9.6B operating cash flow). Recent net income totals over $10.4B, supporting financial resilience. Overall, it appears a stable institution rather than a fly-by-night operator.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating and growing via the ad-supported tier and new advertiser metrics, with ads reaching 190 million viewers in October. Growth metrics are solid, including ~17% revenue growth and positive earnings growth.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage spotlights a 10-for-1 stock split set for Nov. 17 and arguments to buy ahead of it, alongside strong global growth and a successful ad-supported tier. Netflix also reported that ads reached 190 million viewers in October and rolled out a new advertiser-facing engagement metric. Competitors are active, with Paramount Skydance announcing a $3B transformation and Disney’s Q4 preview pointing to a potential 2026 recovery. Quick_facts indicate “Buy the rumor? no; Sell the news? no,” suggesting limited classic rumor/news trading around these headlines.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports on proposed U.S. tariffs on foreign-made films pressured media stocks, including NFLX, when announced. Analysts estimated such tariffs could reduce earnings by roughly 10%–20% and add up to about $3B in annual costs, signaling a potential headwind if enacted.
