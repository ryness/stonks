  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — price is in a 7d downtrend and 3mo 'near-bottom' at 110 near 7d support 108.61 while below the 20-DMA 111.15 and SMA 116.57; macro froth visibility is limited, with 'Overbought/Sold? in the middle' and quick facts showing 'Buy the rumor? no'/'Sell the news? no'.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Netflix operates a single business: a global streaming service providing on-demand episodic television, movies, and documentaries. It serves more than 300 million subscribers worldwide (excluding China) and has historically avoided live programming and sports. The company added ad-supported subscription plans in 2022, expanding beyond subscription fees into advertising revenue.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** Yes — it is profitable, with a 24.05% profit margin, positive net income in recent periods, and strong free cash flow of $23.36B.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are consumers streaming entertainment content across nearly all global markets outside China. Netflix also serves advertisers via its ad-supported plans. Its markets span the United States and international regions, where it holds the largest TV entertainment subscriber base.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include Disney, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery, Apple, Alphabet/YouTube, Comcast, Roku, and Meta; Netflix ranks as the leader by TV entertainment subscribers with 300M+ globally.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — closed 110 after ranging to 113.34 high and 108.61 low, remaining below the 20-DMA 111.15.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near the 108.51–108.61 support/suggested buy zone looked favorable; selling into 115.25 and toward 116.73 resistance offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Netflix appears stable, operating a large-scale streaming platform with more than 300 million subscribers globally. Profitability and cash generation are solid, with a 24.05% profit margin, $10.43B cumulative net income across recent periods, and $23.36B in free cash flow. Operating cash flow of $9.57B and no upcoming earnings listed provide additional cushion. While headlines include a shareholder legal investigation, the financial profile suggests an entrenched institution rather than a fly-by-night.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating and growing — revenue rose 17.2% with earnings growth of 7.8%, and the 2022 ad-supported launch expands into advertising alongside subscriptions.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines note a law firm investigating potential securities violations at Netflix, which can weigh on sentiment. Coverage also highlighted a 10-for-1 stock split and long-term outperformance tied to subscriber and revenue growth. Sector context shows Disney’s streaming gains amid linear TV pressure, and broader tech volatility in markets. With quick facts showing 'Buy the rumor? no' and 'Sell the news? no,' the adage suggests limited edge from chasing rumors or selling on announced news here.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports in May 2025 of potential 100% U.S. tariffs on foreign-made films pressured media stocks and were framed as a negative for Netflix, with analysts estimating around a 10% earnings hit or several dollars per share of EPS impact. Overall, the coverage portrays tariffs as a cost and EPS risk for NFLX.
