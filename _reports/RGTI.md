  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing builds superconducting quantum computers and provides access to its quantum processing units (QPUs) and systems via cloud-based quantum computing as a service (QCaaS). Its offerings include Novera-branded QPUs and the 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system, plus quantum cloud services, operating system software, and professional services such as algorithm development, benchmarking, and application programming.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No; the company remains unprofitable with cumulative net losses (-$164.83M), negative free and operating cash flow, and recent EPS figures still negative with no stated timeline to profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are commercial enterprises and government organizations, including international government entities. The company serves markets in the United States, the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe, Asia, and internationally, primarily delivering access to its systems over the cloud with public/private cloud integrations.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include quantum pure plays like IonQ (IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), as well as programs at large tech firms such as IBM and Alphabet/Google. The data provides no explicit market-share ranking for Rigetti among these peers.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — the price moved from a 36.90 local low toward 44.27 and is approaching 44.52 resistance.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 36.90 was favorable, while selling into 42.93–44.52 (local high/resistance) offered exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Founded in 2013, Rigetti has over a decade of operating history, indicating more than a fly-by-night presence. However, it currently shows persistent losses, negative operating and free cash flow, and a revenue contraction (-41.6%), pointing to financial strain. Volatility is elevated (high ATR% assessment). Inclusion in the Russell 3000 Index (2024) suggests institutional visibility, but the business remains early-stage and capital-intensive.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Rigetti is innovating, evidenced by supporting NVIDIA’s NVQLink to advance hybrid quantum-classical computing and offering the 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system. That said, growth is volatile and recent revenue declined year over year.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines highlight bubble concerns around quantum computing stocks and heightened volatility into Q3 earnings. Select analysts caution some names could fall sharply, while another piece touts Alphabet as the eventual winner. Rigetti specifically announced support for NVIDIA’s NVQLink, positioning for hybrid quantum-classical workloads. In this backdrop, the adage suggests risk of sell-the-news reactions around earnings or partnership updates, aligning with the noted volatility.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Headlines indicate quantum computing stocks, including RGTI, fell amid tariff news, implying tariffs can pressure sentiment and potentially supply chains. Specific quantified impacts on Rigetti’s stock are not provided.
