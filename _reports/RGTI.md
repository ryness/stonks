  ![Rigetti Computing, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/RGTI.svg)
  
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing is a full-stack quantum computing company offering a cloud-based platform via its Rigetti QCS and through major cloud providers. Its proprietary quantum-classical infrastructure enables ultra-low-latency integration with public and private clouds, and it has developed the industry's first multi-chip quantum processor; the majority of revenue is from the United States.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company is not profitable, with cumulative net income of -$164.83M, negative operating and free cash flow, and revenue contracting (-41.6%); a timeline to profitability is not indicated.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end-users who access its quantum computing via the Rigetti QCS platform and through third-party cloud providers. Geographically, most revenue comes from the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include pure-play quantum firms such as IonQ (IONQ), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), as well as platforms from Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia. The data does not specify Rigetti’s market rank among these competitors.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — fell from a 7d high near 44.52 toward the 35.00–36.90 area and sits below the 20-DMA (43.66).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys were better near 36.90 and around the 35.00 support; sells were favorable near the 44.52 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is an emerging U.S. technology company focused on cloud-delivered quantum computing. Recent results show sustained losses (net income sum -$164.83M) with negative operating and free cash flow, signaling financial pressure. Shares exhibit high volatility and recent volume has been relatively low, adding market risk. Overall, it appears less stable than mature, profitable peers.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating, with an industry-first multi-chip quantum processor and proprietary quantum-classical infrastructure, plus a partnership with Nvidia for interconnection. However, reported revenue growth is currently negative.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Shares surged 48.6% in October on bullish analyst commentary, JPMorgan’s tech investment plans citing quantum computing, and a new Nvidia partnership for interconnection. Coverage highlights broader investor interest via a quantum ETF and frames quantum stocks as high-upside but risky. Other pieces warn of a potential bubble after outsized sector gains, tempering exuberance. Elon Musk’s positive reaction to Alphabet’s Echoes algorithm and ‘verifiable quantum advantage’ adds supportive sentiment, but the mix of hype and caution suggests the classic ‘sell the news’ risk after sharp run-ups.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown

![Rigetti Computing, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/RGTI.svg)


## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing is a full-stack quantum computing company offering a cloud-based platform via its Rigetti QCS and through major cloud providers. Its proprietary quantum-classical infrastructure enables ultra-low-latency integration with public and private clouds, and it has developed the industry's first multi-chip quantum processor; the majority of revenue is from the United States.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company is not profitable, with cumulative net income of -$164.83M, negative operating and free cash flow, and revenue contracting (-41.6%); a timeline to profitability is not indicated.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end-users who access its quantum computing via the Rigetti QCS platform and through third-party cloud providers. Geographically, most revenue comes from the United States.

1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include pure-play quantum firms such as IonQ (IONQ), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), as well as platforms from Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia. The data does not specify Rigetti’s market rank among these competitors.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — fell from a 7d high near 44.52 toward the 35.00–36.90 area and sits below the 20-DMA (43.66).

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys were better near 36.90 and around the 35.00 support; sells were favorable near the 44.52 resistance.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is an emerging U.S. technology company focused on cloud-delivered quantum computing. Recent results show sustained losses (net income sum -$164.83M) with negative operating and free cash flow, signaling financial pressure. Shares exhibit high volatility and recent volume has been relatively low, adding market risk. Overall, it appears less stable than mature, profitable peers.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating, with an industry-first multi-chip quantum processor and proprietary quantum-classical infrastructure, plus a partnership with Nvidia for interconnection. However, reported revenue growth is currently negative.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Shares surged 48.6% in October on bullish analyst commentary, JPMorgan’s tech investment plans citing quantum computing, and a new Nvidia partnership for interconnection. Coverage highlights broader investor interest via a quantum ETF and frames quantum stocks as high-upside but risky. Other pieces warn of a potential bubble after outsized sector gains, tempering exuberance. Elon Musk’s positive reaction to Alphabet’s Echoes algorithm and ‘verifiable quantum advantage’ adds supportive sentiment, but the mix of hype and caution suggests the classic ‘sell the news’ risk after sharp run-ups.

4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
