  ![Rigetti Computing, Inc. Common Stock logo](/assets/logos/RGTI.svg)
  
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS and through third-party cloud providers. Its proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure integrates with public and private clouds for ultra‑low latency, and it develops multi‑chip quantum processors for scalable systems.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it reports cumulative net losses (−$164.83M), negative operating and free cash flow, and a 0.0 profit margin; timing to profitability is not disclosed.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are end users accessing quantum computing directly via the Rigetti QCS platform and indirectly through cloud service providers across public and private clouds. The majority of revenue is derived from the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include IonQ (IONQ), D‑Wave Quantum (QBTS), Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), and large platforms from NVIDIA, Alphabet (GOOGL/GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT). Relative market positioning or rank is not specified in the provided data.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — the stock is in an uptrend, testing the 44.52 resistance while holding above the 36.90 support.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 36.90 (support/suggested buy zone) and selling near 44.52 (resistance/suggested sell zone) were the notable levels.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** This is an early-stage company with ongoing net losses and negative operating and free cash flow, indicating elevated financial risk. It derives most revenue in the U.S., but revenue declined 41.6% year over year. Trading shows high volatility (ATR ~13.2% of price). Balance sheet details are not provided here, so overall stability appears limited based on losses and volatility.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating with proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure and what it calls the industry’s first multi‑chip quantum processor, though revenue contraction (−41.6%) signals commercialization is still early.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights strong interest and gains in quantum computing, including a quantum ETF and pieces noting big returns and bubble risks for pure-play names like IonQ, D‑Wave, and Rigetti. Headlines cite Alphabet’s Echoes algorithm showing a verifiable quantum advantage and positive commentary from Elon Musk. Another article points to momentum ahead of an IonQ investor update. This hype‑tilted backdrop can invite buy‑the‑rumor/sell‑the‑news dynamics, but quick facts here flag no clear signal (Buy the rumor? no; Sell the news? no).
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
