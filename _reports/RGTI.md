  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS and through third-party cloud providers. It operates proprietary quantum–classical infrastructure and has developed a multi-chip quantum processor for scalability, with most revenue coming from the U.S.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company remains unprofitable, with cumulative net losses (-$350.96M sum), negative operating and free cash flow, and declining revenue; no timeline to profitability is provided.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end-users accessing quantum compute over the cloud, including those engaged in algorithm development, benchmarking, and application programming. Revenue is predominantly U.S.-based, delivered directly via Rigetti QCS and via public cloud providers.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include IonQ and D-Wave (QBTS) among pure-play quantum firms, and big tech such as Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia; IBM is also cited in coverage. Reports note IonQ generates more revenue than peers, suggesting Rigetti trails leaders on commercialization.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares closed at 28.3, below the 20-DMA (~38.4) and near 7d support (28.05) after failing to hold recent highs.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 28.05–30.62 stood out; selling into strength near 34.71 and toward 38.62 was the opportunity.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is an early-stage but established quantum computing company operating a live cloud platform, not a fleeting shell. However, persistent net losses and negative operating and free cash flow, alongside revenue contraction, indicate financial risk. Inclusion in the Russell 3000 Index (2024) improves visibility and liquidity. Overall stability is constrained by high volatility and lack of profitability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating — it built the industry’s first multi-chip quantum processor and offers proprietary quantum–classical infrastructure, though revenue declined 18.1% year over year.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a roughly 2,000% share-price surge over the past year while cautioning that commercially viable quantum computing could be far off. Articles note intense competition from big tech (Alphabet, IBM) and that IonQ is generating more revenue than many peers. Nvidia’s NVQLink announcement underscores growing ecosystem investment connecting quantum and accelerated computing. Given the mix of hype and sober assessments, any buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news effects appear uneven rather than decisive.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have pressured quantum-computing stocks, with RGTI cited falling alongside peers during tariff news cycles; specific company-level impacts were not detailed.

![Rigetti Computing, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/RGTI.svg)


## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS and through third-party cloud providers. It operates proprietary quantum–classical infrastructure and has developed a multi-chip quantum processor for scalability, with most revenue coming from the U.S.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company remains unprofitable, with cumulative net losses (-$350.96M sum), negative operating and free cash flow, and declining revenue; no timeline to profitability is provided.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end-users accessing quantum compute over the cloud, including those engaged in algorithm development, benchmarking, and application programming. Revenue is predominantly U.S.-based, delivered directly via Rigetti QCS and via public cloud providers.

1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include IonQ and D-Wave (QBTS) among pure-play quantum firms, and big tech such as Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia; IBM is also cited in coverage. Reports note IonQ generates more revenue than peers, suggesting Rigetti trails leaders on commercialization.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares closed at 28.3, below the 20-DMA (~38.4) and near 7d support (28.05) after failing to hold recent highs.

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 28.05–30.62 stood out; selling into strength near 34.71 and toward 38.62 was the opportunity.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is an early-stage but established quantum computing company operating a live cloud platform, not a fleeting shell. However, persistent net losses and negative operating and free cash flow, alongside revenue contraction, indicate financial risk. Inclusion in the Russell 3000 Index (2024) improves visibility and liquidity. Overall stability is constrained by high volatility and lack of profitability.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating — it built the industry’s first multi-chip quantum processor and offers proprietary quantum–classical infrastructure, though revenue declined 18.1% year over year.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a roughly 2,000% share-price surge over the past year while cautioning that commercially viable quantum computing could be far off. Articles note intense competition from big tech (Alphabet, IBM) and that IonQ is generating more revenue than many peers. Nvidia’s NVQLink announcement underscores growing ecosystem investment connecting quantum and accelerated computing. Given the mix of hype and sober assessments, any buy-the-rumor/sell-the-news effects appear uneven rather than decisive.
