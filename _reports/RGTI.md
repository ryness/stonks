  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — historically it sits in the middle of its 3mo–5yr range; quantum-stock froth appears to be unwinding rather than building (short-driven selloffs reported); price is in a downtrend, well below the 20-DMA/EMA (34.54/32.77) but near 23.37 support.
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS and through major cloud providers. It integrates proprietary quantum-classical infrastructure for ultra‑low‑latency workloads and has developed a multi‑chip quantum processor for scale. The company generates most of its revenue in the United States.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** no — profit margin is 0%, cumulative net income is deeply negative (-$350.96M) with negative operating and free cash flow, and revenue declined 18.1%.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** The company serves a wide range of end‑users accessing its quantum systems via QCS and partner cloud providers. Markets are primarily U.S.-based, where it derives the majority of its revenue; customers span practitioners and organizations pursuing quantum applications, including government-related work mentioned in recent coverage.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include IonQ, D-Wave (QBTS), and large tech players developing quantum capabilities (Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, NVIDIA). Recent reports indicate Rigetti trails peers like IonQ in technological progress and government contract wins.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — slipped from the 7d local high 34.71 toward 24.69 and trades below the 20‑DMA 34.54.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Better buys appeared near support around 23.37; sells or trims near resistance around 34.71.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is an early-stage U.S. quantum computing company with cloud-delivered systems, not a shell entity, but it remains financially unproven. It has accumulated sizable losses (-$350.96M), with negative operating (-$52.19M) and free cash flow (-$39.65M). Volatility is elevated (ATR ~13.3% of price) while recent trading volume is low, pointing to higher risk. Inclusion set for the Russell 3000 index (2024) suggests growing institutional recognition. Overall, it is not a fly‑by‑night, but it is not yet a stable, cash‑generative business.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Rigetti is innovating with a full‑stack platform and an industry‑first multi‑chip quantum processor aimed at scalability. However, recent revenue contraction (-18.1%) shows commercial growth is not yet keeping pace with the technology push.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights a Q3 revenue miss (~$1.95M) and pressure from funding/timing challenges, with commentary that Rigetti is behind IonQ and peers in progress and contracts. A separate piece notes shorts profiting as quantum stocks, including Rigetti, fell, underscoring sector skepticism. Another article pitches potential upside into 2025 alongside mentions of early device sales and partnerships, reflecting mixed sentiment. An ETF-focused note points to diversified exposure rather than single-name conviction. Given this backdrop, the data-aligned take is that “buy the rumor, sell the news” hasn’t clearly applied (Buy/Sell rumor/news: no/no) amid predominantly cautious headlines.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Headlines linked tariff announcements to declines across quantum stocks including Rigetti, suggesting potential pressure via supply chain or China-related manufacturing/assembly exposure. Overall impact is directional but limited in detail in the provided data.
