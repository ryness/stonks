  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing is a full-stack quantum computing company delivering its quantum platform as a cloud service via Rigetti QCS and through major cloud providers. It designs and operates proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure with ultra‑low‑latency integration and has built a multi‑chip quantum processor for scalable systems. The company also offers professional services such as algorithm development, benchmarking, application programming, and software support.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company remains unprofitable, with cumulative net losses (-$164.83M), negative operating cash flow (-$53.8M) and free cash flow (-$39.5M); no timeline to profitability is provided in the data.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end users accessing its quantum computing capabilities via the Rigetti QCS platform and partner cloud providers. Customers also engage via professional services (e.g., algorithm development and benchmarking). The majority of revenue comes from the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include pure‑play quantum firms IonQ (IONQ) and D‑Wave (QBTS), and large tech companies with quantum efforts such as Alphabet/Google (GOOGL/GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). The data do not indicate a definitive market share ranking.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price closed at 33.77 below its 20‑day average (42.14) and MACD is slightly negative.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Better buy entries appeared near 34.65 and around support at 30.62, while selling into strength near 44.52 resistance looked favorable.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is a U.S. quantum computing company, but its financial profile is early‑stage with ongoing losses and negative cash flow. The shares are highly volatile (ATR ~13% of price; 52‑week range ~$1.21–$58.15). Inclusion in the Russell 3000 Index in 2024 adds institutional visibility. Overall, the data suggest it is more speculative than a stable, cash‑generative institution.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating, having developed a multi‑chip quantum processor and supporting NVIDIA’s NVQLink for quantum‑classical interconnection. Recent momentum tied to the Nvidia partnership and analyst enthusiasm underscores active development.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage notes Rigetti’s stock jumped 48.6% in October on bullish analyst reports, JPMorgan’s tech investment comments including quantum, and a partnership with Nvidia for interconnection. Nvidia separately announced NVQLink, highlighting growing quantum‑AI links. Other analysis calls Rigetti highly speculative amid competition from big tech. Sector context shows mixed sentiment, with a peer (QCi) down sharply and an ETF pitch highlighting diversification. These headline‑driven surges can invite buy‑the‑rumor/sell‑the‑news behavior around announcements.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Tariff headlines have coincided with sector‑wide pressure on quantum computing stocks, with RGTI cited alongside peers during tariff‑related selloffs. Specific, lasting company‑level impacts are not detailed.

The company also offers professional services such as algorithm development, benchmarking, application programming, and software support.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — the company remains unprofitable, with cumulative net losses (-$164.83M), negative operating cash flow (-$53.8M) and free cash flow (-$39.5M); no timeline to profitability is provided in the data.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end users accessing its quantum computing capabilities via the Rigetti QCS platform and partner cloud providers. Customers also engage via professional services (e.g., algorithm development and benchmarking). The majority of revenue comes from the United States.
