  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered via the cloud, accessible directly through Rigetti QCS and through public cloud providers. Its proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure enables ultra‑low‑latency integration, and it has developed a multi‑chip quantum processor for scalable systems.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with cumulative net losses of about $164.83M, negative free cash flow (-$39.45M) and operating cash flow (-$53.79M), and revenue decline (-41.6%).
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end‑users who access its platform via Rigetti QCS and partner cloud providers. The company derives the majority of its revenue from the United States, indicating a primarily U.S. market focus.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include IONQ, QBTS (D‑Wave Quantum), QUBT, and large platforms such as MSFT, GOOGL/GOOG, and NVDA. Rigetti is one of several pure‑play quantum firms competing alongside these larger tech companies; specific market ranking is not provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up — price pushed toward resistance (44.52) with a higher close versus open on the latest day (44.27 vs 42.23) and an uptrend label.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Levels near 36.90 (support/suggested buy zone) offered better entries, while around 44.52 (resistance/suggested sell zone) provided exits. The current price at 40.29 sits between these zones.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti appears more emerging than mature, given its financial profile. It has cumulative net losses (-$164.83M), negative free cash flow (-$39.45M) and operating cash flow (-$53.79M), and revenue contraction (-41.6%), which point to limited financial stability. Trading characteristics show high volatility and recently low volume. No balance sheet or cash runway details are provided in the data.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** It is innovating, with a full‑stack cloud platform, proprietary quantum‑classical integration, and what it describes as the industry’s first multi‑chip quantum processor. However, revenue growth is negative, indicating that innovation has not yet translated into top‑line growth.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent headlines focus on sector‑wide quantum enthusiasm: a quantum computing ETF, debate over a potential bubble after large gains in pure‑play names including Rigetti, and anticipation around IonQ’s investor update. Alphabet’s Echoes algorithm and positive commentary from Elon Musk add to the buzz about quantum progress. While such themes can spur “buy the rumor” dynamics, the quick facts here indicate “no” for buy‑the‑rumor and sell‑the‑news, and no RGTI‑specific catalysts are identified in the supplied headlines.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
