  ![Rigetti Computing, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/RGTI.svg)
  
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS and through cloud service providers. Its proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure enables ultra‑low latency integration with public and private clouds, and it has developed a multi‑chip quantum processor to scale systems.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No—cumulative net losses (net income sum -$164.8M) with negative operating and free cash flow, and the data provides no timeline to profitability.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are end‑users accessing quantum compute via cloud platforms, both directly through Rigetti QCS and via third‑party cloud providers. The company derives most revenue from the United States, serving a broad set of cloud‑based use cases.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include pure‑plays like IonQ (IONQ), D‑Wave Quantum (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT), as well as large platforms such as Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia. Rigetti is one of several pure‑play quantum firms competing against far larger tech companies; specific market ranking isn’t provided.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** up; price moved from 36.90 support toward 44.52 resistance and the 7d trend label is up.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 36.90 support looked attractive, while selling or trimming near 44.52 resistance was sensible.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is a specialized quantum computing provider but appears financially fragile in this data. It reports significant net losses and negative operating and free cash flow, alongside a 41.6% revenue decline. Recent trading shows high volatility, adding risk. Balance sheet and liquidity details are not provided here.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating—its proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure and an industry‑first multi‑chip quantum processor indicate active R&D, though reported revenue is contracting.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlights sector‑wide enthusiasm, including a quantum computing ETF and debate over a potential bubble after outsized gains that included Rigetti. Articles cite Alphabet’s reported ‘verifiable quantum advantage’ and positive remarks from Elon Musk, which buoy sentiment. Another piece flags momentum into an IonQ investor update, signaling broader investor interest. While this backdrop can invite buy‑the‑rumor/sell‑the‑news behavior, QuickRef currently flags ‘no’ for both.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** unknown
