  ![Rigetti Computing, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/RGTI.svg)
  
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS and through cloud service providers. Its proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure enables ultra‑low latency integration with public and private clouds, and it has built the industry’s first multi‑chip quantum processor to scale systems.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with negative net income (cumulative −$164.83M), negative operating cash flow, and negative free cash flow; no timing to profitability is provided in the data.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are end‑users accessing its quantum computing via the Rigetti QCS platform and through third‑party cloud providers for practical quantum workloads. Most revenue is derived from the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include pure‑play quantum firms like IonQ and D‑Wave Quantum (QBTS), as well as big tech players Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia active in quantum computing. Rigetti is a smaller pure‑play competing against these larger incumbents.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares fell from a recent 7d high near 44.52 to about 33.15 and trade well below the 20‑DMA (~42.11).
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 34.65 or closer to 32.13 support looked favorable, while selling into 44.52 resistance offered a good exit.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is an early‑stage U.S. quantum computing company rather than a fly‑by‑night, and it was set to join the Russell 3000 Index in 2024. However, it remains financially fragile with sustained losses (net income sum −$164.83M), negative operating cash flow, and negative free cash flow. Revenue contracted year over year (−41.6%), and the stock exhibits high volatility, underscoring elevated risk. Overall, its financial profile points to a speculative, higher‑risk company.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating, evidenced by developing the industry’s first multi‑chip quantum processor and collaborating with Nvidia on NVQLink quantum interconnection. Growth interest is reflected in October’s stock surge tied to analyst support and broader sector investment signals.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlighted Nvidia’s NVQLink announcement and Rigetti’s October rally driven by bullish analyst reports, JPMorgan’s quantum spending commentary, and a partnership with Nvidia for interconnection. Other articles frame the stock as highly speculative despite gains and note broader quantum interest via ETFs. Through a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ lens, the move appears buzz‑aided, but quick‑facts indicate ‘buy the rumor? no’ and ‘sell the news? no,’ suggesting no clear fade‑the‑news setup in the supplied data.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate quantum‑computing stocks, including RGTI, have swung on tariff headlines, adding short‑term volatility to the group. Coverage also notes tariffs could pressure costs tied to China‑related manufacturing and assembly.

![Rigetti Computing, Inc. Common Stock logo](https://ryness.github.io/stonks/assets/logos/RGTI.svg)


## 1. The Biz

1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS and through cloud service providers. Its proprietary quantum‑classical infrastructure enables ultra‑low latency integration with public and private clouds, and it has built the industry’s first multi‑chip quantum processor to scale systems.

1.2. **Profitable?:** No — it is not profitable, with negative net income (cumulative −$164.83M), negative operating cash flow, and negative free cash flow; no timing to profitability is provided in the data.

1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers are end‑users accessing its quantum computing via the Rigetti QCS platform and through third‑party cloud providers for practical quantum workloads. Most revenue is derived from the United States.

1.4. **Competition:** Competitors include pure‑play quantum firms like IonQ and D‑Wave Quantum (QBTS), as well as big tech players Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia active in quantum computing. Rigetti is a smaller pure‑play competing against these larger incumbents.

## 2. Recent

2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — shares fell from a recent 7d high near 44.52 to about 33.15 and trade well below the 20‑DMA (~42.11).

2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near 34.65 or closer to 32.13 support looked favorable, while selling into 44.52 resistance offered a good exit.

2.3.1. **7d Volume:** low

2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high

## 3. Longterm

3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is an early‑stage U.S. quantum computing company rather than a fly‑by‑night, and it was set to join the Russell 3000 Index in 2024. However, it remains financially fragile with sustained losses (net income sum −$164.83M), negative operating cash flow, and negative free cash flow. Revenue contracted year over year (−41.6%), and the stock exhibits high volatility, underscoring elevated risk. Overall, its financial profile points to a speculative, higher‑risk company.

3.2. **Innovating?:** Yes — it is innovating, evidenced by developing the industry’s first multi‑chip quantum processor and collaborating with Nvidia on NVQLink quantum interconnection. Growth interest is reflected in October’s stock surge tied to analyst support and broader sector investment signals.

## 4. Context

4.1. **News:** Recent coverage highlighted Nvidia’s NVQLink announcement and Rigetti’s October rally driven by bullish analyst reports, JPMorgan’s quantum spending commentary, and a partnership with Nvidia for interconnection. Other articles frame the stock as highly speculative despite gains and note broader quantum interest via ETFs. Through a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ lens, the move appears buzz‑aided, but quick‑facts indicate ‘buy the rumor? no’ and ‘sell the news? no,’ suggesting no clear fade‑the‑news setup in the supplied data.
