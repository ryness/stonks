  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are in a 7d downtrend and trading well below the 20-DMA/EMA (32.45/31.52) near support at 21 after a local low at 23.37; macro froth cues are limited (Overbought/Sold: in the middle; 3mo/1yr/5yr: middle).
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Rigetti Computing provides a full-stack quantum computing platform delivered as a cloud service via its Rigetti QCS platform and through major cloud providers. Its proprietary quantum–classical infrastructure enables ultra-low latency integration with public and private clouds. The company has developed what it describes as the industry's first multi-chip quantum processor for scalable systems.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** No — cumulative net income is negative (-$350.96M), profit margin is 0.0%, and both free cash flow and operating cash flow are negative, with revenue growth at -18.1%.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Rigetti serves a wide range of end-users via its Rigetti QCS and through cloud service providers, enabling access to its quantum systems across industries. Geographically, the majority of its revenue is derived from the United States.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Primary competitors include pure-plays IonQ (IONQ), D-Wave/Quantum (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), as well as large tech players Alphabet/Google (GOOGL/GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Rigetti is positioned among early-stage pure-play peers rather than the diversified leaders.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — price fell from a local high of 27.18 toward 23.59 and remains below nearby 7d resistance at 27.41 and the 20-DMA.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buys looked better near 23.37 and especially closer to support at 21. Sells were favorable near 27.18–27.41 resistance.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** high
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Rigetti is a specialized technology company in quantum computing with ongoing losses (net income sum -$350.96M), negative free cash flow, and negative operating cash flow, indicating financial strain. However, a recent article cited a $600M cash pile providing runway through 2027, which supports near-term liquidity. Volatility is elevated (ATR ~12.75% of price), reflecting higher risk. Inclusion in index discussions (set to join the Russell 3000 in 2024 per company release) suggests growing institutional visibility, but overall stability remains challenged by persistent unprofitability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Innovating — the company highlights an industry-first multi-chip quantum processor and quantum–classical infrastructure, though revenue growth is currently negative. Execution appears focused on technology advancement while financial growth lags.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent coverage is mixed: one article urged selling Rigetti with a projected 20% downside on weak financials, while another argued the Q3 revenue miss is less important than a sizable $600M cash reserve. A comparison piece said Rigetti looks more promising than Quantum Computing Inc. on current capabilities, yet another advised that Alphabet is a safer quantum bet than pure-plays like Rigetti. A separate note questioned buying the dip as Rigetti reportedly trails IonQ on some fronts. Given these cross-currents and quick facts signaling no clear ‘buy the rumor’ or ‘sell the news,’ the adage offers limited edge here.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate quantum computing stocks including RGTI fell on tariff headlines, and wider tariffs could have short-term impact on the group. Specific long-term tariff effects on RGTI are not detailed beyond these market reactions.
