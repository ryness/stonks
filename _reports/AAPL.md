  ## 0. Entry Radar
  
  0.1. **Long Entry?:** maybe — shares are near-peak on 3mo/1yr/5yr and in a labeled downtrend, sitting just above 7d support at 265.32 and slightly below the 20-DMA 269.15 while still above the SMA/EMA (~257); macro froth cues are present as AI-led tech dominates headlines and quick facts flag 'Sell the news? yes', limiting visibility for a clean entry
  
  ## 1. The Biz
  
  1.1. **Activities:** Apple designs and sells consumer electronics (iPhone, Mac, iPad, Watch) and an integrated software/services ecosystem. It also develops its own software and semiconductors, while subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC manufacture its products. Services include streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality, with sales split between Apple stores and partner/distribution channels.
  
  1.2. **Profitable?:** yes — Apple is profitable with a ~26.9% profit margin, $112.0B in net income over the last four quarters, and $78.9B in free cash flow.
  
  1.3. **Customer & Markets:** Primary customers include consumers and businesses (small/mid-sized, enterprise), as well as education and government markets. Apple serves a global market from the United States, selling directly via flagship stores and indirectly through partnerships and distribution.
  
  1.4. **Competition:** Key competitors include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Netflix, and Disney; Apple ranks among the largest companies in the world within this peer set.
  
  ## 2. Recent
  
  2.1. **7d Trend?:** down — the 7d Trend is down and the setup is labeled a downtrend, with the 268.56 close sitting below the 20-DMA 269.15.
  
  2.2. **7d Buy/Sell Points?:** Buying near support around 265.32 (7d/local low) looked favorable; trimming or selling into 276.70 (7d/local high resistance) offered better exits.
  
  2.3.1. **7d Volume:** med
  
  2.3.2. **7d Volatility:** med
  
  ## 3. Longterm
  
  3.1. **Stability?:** Apple is an established mega-cap technology company with a long operating history. It shows strong cash generation (operating cash flow $111.5B, free cash flow $78.9B) and robust profitability (~26.9% margin). Trailing net income totals $112.0B across the last four quarters, indicating consistent earnings power. Its diversified hardware, software, and services ecosystem and broad distribution channels further underpin stability.
  
  3.2. **Innovating?:** Apple is innovating and growing, adding services (streaming, bundles, augmented reality) and designing its own semiconductors. Revenue growth of 7.9% and earnings growth of 86.4% support this momentum.
  
  ## 4. Context
  
  4.1. **News:** Recent sector context highlights tech ETF positioning (VGT, FTEC), quality stocks lagging like 1999 while AI leaders dominate, and Nvidia’s upcoming earnings as a key sentiment catalyst for AI-related names. Another headline underscores TSMC’s central role in AI chips, relevant to broader supply chains Apple uses. Apple-specific news includes job listings suggesting potential Intel Foundry packaging collaboration, hinting at supply chain and chip packaging developments. Given these crosscurrents, “buy the rumor, sell the news” risk seems elevated around AI-linked events, which aligns with quick facts indicating ‘Buy the rumor? no’ and ‘Sell the news? yes’.
  
  4.2. **Tarrifs:** Reports indicate tariffs can pressure Apple’s results and margins (e.g., a cited ~$900M quarterly tariff hit and potential gross margin impact), though pauses/exemptions and mitigation steps (like front-loading shipments) have at times reduced the impact and supported the stock.
